<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>On my return to California, after an absence of many
years, my attention was called, for the first time, to the
fact that my name had been associated unpleasantly
with the great diamond fraud that startled the financial
world nearly half a century ago. Plain duty to my
family name and reputation compelled me to tell the
whole story of that strange incident so far as my knowledge
of it extends. I sincerely trust that a candid reading
of these pages will satisfy the public that I was only
a dupe, along with some of the most distinguished
financiers of the last generation. Concerning two of
the historians who maligned me, I am without redress.
They are dead. The latest author, Mr. John P. Young,
repeated the accusation of his predecessors in his history
of San Francisco. This gentleman has admitted
that he merely copied the story of the earlier works,
having no personal knowledge of events at that period,
and has handsomely admitted, over his signature, that
he unconsciously did me an injustice.</p>

<p>To the diamond story I have added, at the request of
friends, some of my experiences and reminiscences of
California of the early days.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I.<br />

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Early Years&mdash;My Voyage to California.</span></span></h2>

<p>My father was one of the largest landed proprietors
of Kentucky, in the southwestern section of the State.
That was still on the frontier of the Far West. Beyond
stretched the land of enchantment and adventure&mdash;the
plains, the mountains, the unbroken solitudes, the wild
Indians, the buffaloes and the Golden State on the shore
of the Pacific.</p>

<p>Youngsters whose minds are occupied today with baseball
and tennis and who still retain a lingering love for
taffy, sixty years ago on the frontier were dreaming of
wild adventures that were nearly always realized to some
extent. We lived on the border line, where the onward
wave of emigration broke and scattered over the vast
vacancies of the West, and it is hardly saying too much
to assert that fully seven boys in ten were caught and
carried forward with the flood before they had gone very
far in their teens.</p>

<p>For myself, I simply gave up to the spirit of the times.
At the age of fifteen I ran away from college to join an
aggregation of young gentlemen but little older than
myself, who enlisted under the banner of General Walker,
the filibuster. The objective was the conquest of Nicaragua.
The Walker expedition sailed to its destination
and what followed is a matter of well known history.
But for my companions and myself, numbering 120 in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
all, it ended in a humiliating disaster. For, as we sailed
down the Mississippi River the long arm of Uncle Sam
reached out and caught us, like a bunch of truant kids.
I managed to elude my captors, and after various wanderings
and strange experience made my way to the
paternal home in a condition that made the Prodigal
Son look like 30 cents.</p>

<p>That didn’t abate the wandering fever in the slightest
and in order that I might not commit myself to another
Walker expedition, my father consented that I should
try my luck in California and I started with his blessing
and what seemed to me a liberal grub stake. I had just
turned sixteen.</p>

<p>Instead of going to New York and taking passage
from that port, I decided to travel down the Mississippi
River, have a look at New Orleans and leave on one of
the various steamers there that connected with the Pacific
Mail at Darien.</p>

<p>Here an unforeseen calamity very nearly upset all my
plans. My money consisted of currency, issued under
the auspices of the various States. A financial storm of
some kind had just swept the country and the currency
became legal tender only in the borders of the State of
issuance. All that I could realize on my bills was barely
enough to buy a steerage ticket to California. That,
together with five dollars in gold coin and a revolver
comprised my earthly possessions.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>THE AUTHOR AT 16</p>

<p>Taken just before his migration
to California</p></div></div>

<p>At Panama we were crowded into a small steamer
designed for about 400 passengers, but nearly 1,000 were
crammed into it. Conditions in the steerage were appalling.
Besides, the ship was under-provisioned and we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
soon ran short of anything like vegetables and fruit.
The purser had thriftily laid in a large private supply of
oranges and bananas for sale in San Francisco. These
he had divided into two caches. The hungry mob seized
on one of them, located between decks, in the night,
and cleaned it up to the uttermost peel. The purser
knew only too well that the next night would witness
the disappearance of the balance of his property. He
was in despair. An inspiration seized me.</p>

<p>“How much will you take cash for the lot?” I asked
him.</p>

<p>“Give me $10 for them and it’s a bargain,” he answered.</p>

<p>I fished out that lonesome $5 piece, paid it on account
and made some vague excuse about getting the other
five from my bunk. I was given permission also to hold
a fruit auction sale on the upper deck.</p>

<p>Being a fruit peddler shocked my southern ideas of a
gentleman’s employment. Nothing but downright poverty
could have driven me to it. However, I took the
edge off the thing as far as possible by employing an
itinerant gambler, also dead broke, to act as general
salesman and orator while I took in the cash. He had a
voice like a fog horn and the gall of a highwayman.
He cried our wares with such success that in a few
minutes the whole ship’s company was engaged in mad
competition to buy oranges and bananas at five for a
half. It would have been just the same if I had made
the price five for a dollar.</p>

<p>Money rolled in faster than I could count it. I could
see that my chief of staff was “knocking down” on me
in a shameless way, but I didn’t have time to check his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
activities&mdash;in fact, I didn’t care. In a little over an hour,
the last orange and banana had vanished. I settled
accounts with the purser and counted my capital. I had
a little over $400 to the good, enough to make a decent
start in California.</p>

<p>I do not tell this incident because it is noteworthy in
itself. Instances were then so common of needy gentlemen
who extricated themselves from the financial bog by
some shift which in other days they would have thought
ignoble&mdash;almost disgraceful&mdash;that this event would not
be worth recalling; but in the peculiar way that destiny
is worked out, it had a decisive part in directing very
important matters of the future. And it has been my
observation that the most impressive movements in the
lives of most of us have been determined more by chance
than by a fixed purpose.</p>

<p>Among those who watched my fruit sale with interest
was a gentleman named Harvey Evarts. He was a
successful plumber in California and was returning from
a trip to the “States,” whither he had gone with a party
of bankers, mine owners and others of fortune commensurate
with his own. Plumbers were not in 1857 the
financial giants that they have become today. Still their
stars were in the ascendant and Mr. Evarts was one of
the brilliant luminaries in the sky.</p>

<p>This gentleman approached me after the sale. I had
transferred at once from the steerage to the upper deck,
as became my altered fortune, and he congratulated me
in a pleasant way on my extraordinary good luck. I
told him all about myself in boy fashion and when we
reached San Francisco we had become so well acquainted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
that Mr. Evarts invited me to accompany him to Camptonville,
then a great mining district, now off the map,
so far as the yellow metal goes, where he had important
interests.</p>

<p>Placer mining was on the toboggan in 1857, when I
arrived in California. All the great “bars” and gulches
had been located and worked out. Very few individual
strikes were made after that date. I do not know
whether it was good judgment or just a case of pure
“nigger luck,” but at all events it happened that even in
those days of declining fortune, every suggestion that
Mr. Evarts gave me turned to gold. He advised me to
take a chance at the head of a couple of abandoned
gulches. In both cases I struck it rich enough to add
$6,000 to my working capital. Again he suggested a
lease of a hydraulic mine on what was known as Railroad
Hill, which had been the ruin of several experienced
miners. I followed his advice and after being brought
to the verge of bankruptcy struck it rich, to my way of
thinking, and cleaned up finally with $60,000 to my
credit, all before my 17th birthday.</p>

<p>I visited the newly discovered Comstock Lode. Didn’t
like it, for deep mining seemed too slow a way of making
money. Later I had a spectacular race with Jim Fair,
then a hustling prospector, to locate a mining claim in
Utah. But the tales of mountains gorged with wealth
vanished when we got there.</p>

<p>Then I began to listen to a lot of mining camp talk
about Mexico and its riches. California and Nevada
were growing dull to my way of thinking and I turned
my thoughts to the land of Montezuma.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">My Experience in Mexico.</span><br /><br />

<i>How Luck Again Brought Me Fortune.</i></span></h2>

<p>All the early gold seekers of California had some
knowledge of Mexico. The great argosies of the Pacific
Mail Steamship Company stopped at various points, such
as Acapulco, Manzanillo and sometimes at Mazatlan.
Thus the passengers gained a sort of hurricane deck
impression of the Latin nation to the southward. But it
extended no further than these glimpses of the coast. A
veil of profound mystery and romance shut out a view
of the vast interior. Only, we knew that it was immensely
rich in precious metals, but so utterly lawless
and overrun with bandits that nothing short of a standing
army could protect an investment.</p>

<p>Thus none of the adventurous pioneers attempted to
explore and prospect the west coast of Mexico, which
later poured its hundreds of millions into California. I
may be mistaken, but I have a strong impression that I
was the first of a long line of miners who went from
San Francisco to Mexico and laid the foundation there
for mighty fortunes.</p>

<p>Very much like Jason, when he pushed his classic junk
from Greece, I started on my ventures in Mexico. I
bought a small trading vessel, hired an excellent crew,
several of whom spoke Spanish, took very little money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
along, but a large cargo of goods suitable to the wants
of the country. In other words, I figured to make the
expedition finance itself. In this I was fairly successful.
After sailing up the Gulf of California and stopping at
various ports, we arrived at Mazatlan, my original objective
point, my cargo sold out.</p>

<p>There was a small American colony at Mazatlan and
several groups of foreigners of other nationalities, all of
them of the trading class. When I suggested a prospecting
expedition into the interior, they assured me it
was little better than suicide; that the country was in
the absolute possession of outlaws of the most desperate
type, and that a prospector’s life would not be worth ten
cents among them.</p>

<p>But I met a Mexican gentleman by the name of Don
Miguel Paredis, who told me a very different story. He
said that the dangers were grossly exaggerated&mdash;that
there was really little to fear for anyone who understood
the people. As a guaranty of good faith he
offered to go with me, for at the time he happened to
be broke&mdash;not an unusual incipient in the life of a Mexican
gentleman. Moreover, he promised to lead me to a
mine of fabulous riches, in the mountains of Durango,
about two hundred miles from Mazatlan. So we set out
with a complete mining outfit, powder, steel, tools, general
equipment and provisions for six months.</p>

<p>Don Miguel certainly understood his business. We
really were in no more real danger than if we had been
traveling through one of the New England States. We
did meet some uncommonly tough-looking citizens,
armed to the teeth, but Don Miguel always rode forward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
to meet them, handed out some specious palaver in
Spanish, whereupon the whole party would disembark
from their mules or horses, embrace each other on the
trail, pass around some more palaver and part with
mutual esteem. The Don was a marvel as a peacemaker
and I might add that for genuine good-fellowship and
clean dealing in all respects he was one of the finest men
of any nation I have met in a long life.</p>

<p>Finally, we reached his mine. This was known for
years after as the Guadaloupe de los Angeles mine. He
hadn’t exaggerated its riches, hadn’t told half the truth.
The vein ran straight up the almost perpendicular face
of a narrow gorge. It was merely a case of breaking
down the ore as in an open cut. There were no shafts,
tunnels, drifts, and winzes that take the heart out of
quartz mining as a rule. And the ore was so rich that
with careful sorting it was possible to make large cargoes
average $500 or $600 a ton.</p>

<p>We never attempted to “beneficiate” or reduce the ore
on the spot. Don Miguel was altogether too shrewd
for that. Had bullion trains gone through the mountains
from our camp it would have taken a standing
army to protect them. We simply bought mules and
burros, loaded them with rock that no bandit wanted,
though it was worth perhaps five hundred dollars a ton.
It very seldom failed to reach the seaboard, where there
were crude reduction works and plenty of purchasers
of ore.</p>

<p>Even our inbound pack trains of costly supplies were
unmolested. Don Miguel was forever practicing diplomacy.
If a robber appeared at our hacienda he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
received like a friend and brother, had the best of everything,
couldn’t say “mas vino” too often, was handed a
liberal “gratification” or tip and limitless “felicidades” on
his departure. By the exercise of these arts, the management
became so popular that on several occasions
our pack trains were actually protected by professional
bandits against marauding amateurs.</p>

<p>We never had a bit of trouble in our camp with the
large number of people assembled there. This also was
due to Don Miguel’s forethought and knowledge of his
people. As far as I can recollect, give the average
Mexican plenty of grub, plenty of music, plenty of
dancing, a little cheap finery in dress, and the rest of
the world can wag on as it will, for aught he cares.
He does not take kindly to abstractions, doesn’t worry
over his “wrongs,” has no inclination to reorganize
society; only wants to be let alone to enjoy the good
things of life according to his own simple plan. And
when you get down to brass tacks, his is not a bad
philosophy, after all.</p>

<p>Don Miguel arranged it so that our little army of
employees never had time to meditate mischief. He
bought them all kinds of musical instruments, including
a brass band on which they became proficient in a wonderfully
short time. Every night there was a “baile” in
the plaza at which the people danced till they fell from
exhaustion. He offered cash prizes&mdash;mighty stiff ones&mdash;for
the best dancers, male and female&mdash;the choice to be
determined among themselves by a plebiscite or by select
committee. Also, on Sundays, we had a bull fight. It
wasn’t of the sanguinary description; the bulls weren’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
killed, but were thriftily kept in cold storage to fight
another day. It made a satisfactory sport for the
people, and was also inexpensive. Added to this, we
paid high wages in hard cash and kept in stock at our
store an assortment of articles for personal decoration
at prices that were highly profitable but not prohibitive.</p>

<p>Thus our enterprise became a big success from every
standpoint. At a time when nearly all the mines in the
Sierra Madre were closed down&mdash;practically abandoned&mdash;we
were swinging along under a full head of steam,
without the slightest interruption, with the general good
will of all with whom we came in contact. Besides, we
were making money at a rate sufficient to turn one’s
brain. I doubt if ever such a return was made on the
trifling sum invested. There had been no development
expense. The mine paid from the very day we began
to operate it.</p>

<p>While I was the “capitalist” and owned, by our agreement,
two-thirds of the property, I allowed Don Miguel
an absolute free hand in all matters of policy; wherein
I showed a wisdom superior to my years. And I followed
his advice in one matter so important that I must
mention it for the general good of mankind.</p>

<p>The women of the Mexican Sierra are remarkable
for their physical charms. There were many real
beauties resident in our camp&mdash;“simpaticas,” they used
to call them&mdash;which doesn’t mean “sympathetics,” but
“good lookers.” Now, I have always believed that a
good looking woman was made to be looked at, to be
admired; otherwise, wherefore was she created? Down
in Mexico I could no more fail to notice a “simpatica”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
as she passed by, than I could close my eyes to the
beauties of nature.</p>

<p>Observing which, Don Miguel gave me a piece of
advice which every reader of this chapter who may
happen to visit Mexico should write down for future
reference.</p>

<p>“Leave our women alone,” he counseled me. “They
are romantic, soft-hearted and will meet you half way,
but no matter how innocent your intercourse, it will
rouse jealousy, ill-will and serious danger. Nearly all
the foreigners who get into trouble in Mexico can trace
it to this source.”</p>

<p>I realized the truth of this later when a young friend
of mine called Eaton, who was a fine fellow but an
ardent imitator of Lothario the Gay, was shot down in
a lonely spot, jealousy being the evident motive.</p>

<p>In the fall of 1860 I returned to San Francisco, as I
thought for a brief trip. Just to show myself, in fact.
Among other things, I brought a few tons of ore that
sold for $3,000 a ton, the sight of which made the town
delirious. I found that my fame, or rather various
romances, had preceded me. I wasn’t quite twenty,
couldn’t vote, couldn’t make a legal contract, yet I had
over a quarter of a million in hard cash to my credit
in bank, and my mine in Mexico was worth a million
more. These were the actual facts, which were exaggerated
and distorted beyond all resemblance to the
truth. My wealth was at least quadrupled, and I was
dragged through a series of bloodcurdling experiences
in Mexico without a parallel in fiction.</p>

<p>Thus, you can see how the orange and banana sale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
incident set the wheels of fate revolving. If I had
come to California with sufficient money. I would have
made some kind of a blind stagger at luck, thrown up
the sponge in disgust after a few months, and written
to my father for a remittance to come home.</p>

<p>As it was, I quietly took rank with the great figures
of the State before I had reached my majority, and
became a leading actor in an unwritten page of history,
when the destinies of California hung by the veriest
thread.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Story of Southern Plan to Make California Secede
From the Union Is Told for First Time.</span><br /><br />

<i>Narrator Describes His Invitation Into Band of 30,
Which Planned to Organize Republic of Pacific.</i></span></h2>

<p>I had barely reached San Francisco when the election
of 1860 took place, resulting in the choice of Abraham
Lincoln as President of the United States. All
through the South this was accepted as the signal for
a civil contest. The work of organization went ahead
with feverish haste and long before the inauguration
of the new President the authority of the Federal Government
was paralyzed in most of the slave States.</p>

<p>The attitude of California was a matter of supreme
moment, not understood, however, at the time. Had
this isolated State on the Pacific joined the Confederate
States, it would have complicated the problems
of war profoundly. With the city of San Francisco
and its then impregnable fortifications in Confederate
hands the outward flow of gold, on which the Union
cause depended in a large measure, would have ceased,
as a stream of water is shut off by turning a faucet.
It was the easiest thing in the world to open and
maintain connection through savage Arizona into
Texas, one of the strongholds of the South. It does
not need a military expert to figure out what a vital<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
advantage to the Confederacy the control of the Pacific
would have proved.</p>

<p>History relates in a few brief words how the secession
movement here was extinguished by a wild outburst
of patriotism. I am now going to relate for the
first time the inside story of the well-planned effort
to carry California out of the Union and by what
a narrow margin it finally failed of accomplishment
when success was absolutely secured.</p>

<p>I was young, hot-headed, filled with the bitter sectional
feeling that was more intense in the border
States than in the States farther north or south. It
would have been hard to find a more reckless secessionist
than myself. I moved among my own people,
got off all sorts of wild talk about spending the last
dollar of my money, and my life, if need be, to resist
the tyrant’s yoke, and so forth, and was actually about
to leave for my home in Kentucky to be ready for the
impending struggle, when a quiet tip was given me
that more important work was cut out where I was.
My exaggerated wealth and the irresponsible stories
of my Mexican exploits, made me an actor in a great,
silent drama, despite my years and boyish look.</p>

<p>One afternoon I was told to be at the house of a
well-known Southern sympathizer at 9 o’clock in the
evening. It was well apart from other buildings, with
entrances in several directions. The gentleman who
owned it lived alone, with only Asiatic attendants,
who understood little English and cared less for what
was going on. A soft-footed domestic opened the
door, took my card, and presently I was ushered into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
a large room where a number of gentlemen, most of
them young but well established, were seated at a
long table. I recognized among them leading men of
San Francisco of various walks of life.</p>

<p>The spokesman, a great man of affairs, told me that
I was trusted, that I had been selected as one to lead
in an affair of great peril, an enterprise on which the
future of the South might depend, and asked me if
I were ready to risk life and fortune on the turn. I
answered with an eagerness that satisfied my hearers
and took an oath, of which I have a copy, reading as
follows:</p>

<p>“Do you, in the presence of Almighty God, swear
that what I may this night say to or show you shall
be kept secret and sacred, and that you will not by
hint, action or word reveal the same to any living
being, so help me God?”</p>

<p>The answer, of course, being an affirmative, I repeated
after the spokesman the following objuration:</p>

<p>“Having been brought to this room for the purpose
of having a secret confided to me and believing that
to divulge such secret would imperil the lives of certain
Southern men as well as injure the cause of the
Southern States, I do solemnly swear in the name of
the Southern States, within whose limits I was born
and reared, that I will never, by word, sign or deed,
hint at or divulge what I may hear to-night. Not to
my dearest friend, not to the wife of my bosom will
I communicate the nature of the secret. I hold myself
pledged, by all I hold dear in heaven or on earth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
by God and my country, by my honor as a Southern
gentleman, to keep inviolate the trust reposed in me.
I swear that no consideration of property or friendship
shall influence my secrecy, and may I meet at
the hands of those I betray, the vengeance due to a
traitor, if I prove recreant to this my solemn obligation.
So help me God, as I prove true.”</p>

<p>This oath was committed to memory by every
member. At subsequent meetings it was solemnly
recited by all, standing and with right hand uplifted,
before proceeding to further business. Several years
afterwards, while it was still fresh in my recollection,
I set it down in writing and preserved it to the present
day. Thus I became one of a society of thirty
members, pledged to carry California out of the Union.</p>

<p>I might say here, in parenthesis, that I have long
been a reconstructed “rebel.” The old flag floats over
my home on every national holiday and also on Labor
day, for I take an interest in the ideas it represents.
I am mighty glad now that my efforts to disrupt the
Union failed and still gladder because it has been my
good fortune to see the awful heritage of hate that so
long divided two brave and generous people die out
and disappear.</p>

<p>The Southern mind has a wonderful capacity for
secret organization and for conducting operations on
a vast scale behind a screen of impenetrable mystery.
This had a fine illustration in the workings of the
Ku-Klux-Klan, in reconstruction days, which destroyed
carpet-bag rule and negro supremacy in the South
and restored the government of the white race. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
operations of the committee of thirty of which I became
a member demonstrated the same peculiar trait.</p>

<p>The organization was simplicity itself. We were
under the absolute orders of a member whom we
called “General.” He called all the meetings, by word
of mouth, passed by one of the members. Anything
in the way of writing was burned before the meeting
broke up. The General received the large contributions
in private, never drew a check, settled all accounts
in gold coin and accounted to himself for the
expenditure.</p>

<p>Each member was responsible for the organization
of a fighting force of say a hundred men. This was
not difficult. California at that period abounded with
reckless human material&mdash;ex-veterans of the Mexican
war, ex-filibusters, ex-Indian fighters, all eager to engage
in any undertaking that promised adventure and
profit. Each member selected a trusty agent, or captain
devoted to the cause of the South, simply told
him to gather a body of picked men for whose equipment
and pay he would be responsible, said nothing
of the service intended, possibly left the impression
that a filibuster expedition was in the wind. These
various bands were scattered in out-of-the-way places
around the bay, ostensibly engaged in some peaceful
occupation, such as chopping wood, fishing or the like,
but in reality waiting for the word to act. Each member
of the committee kept his own counsel. Only the
General knew the location of the various detachments.</p>

<p>Our plans were to paralyze all organized resistance
by a simultaneous attack. The Federal army was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
little more than a shadow. About two hundred soldiers
were at Fort Point, less than a hundred at Alcatraz
and a handful at Mare Island and at the arsenal
at Benicia, where 30,000 stand of arms were
stored. We proposed to carry these strongholds by
a night attack and also seize the arsenals of the militia
at San Francisco. With this abounding military
equipment, we proposed to organize an army of Southern
sympathizers, sufficient in number to beat down
any unarmed resistance.</p>

<p>All of which may seem chimerical at this late day,
but then, take my word, it was an opportunity absolutely
within our grasp. At least 30 per cent. of the
population of California was from the South. The
large foreign element was either neutral or had Southern
leanings. We had already, under practical discipline,
a body of the finest fighting men in the world,
far more than enough to take the initial step with a
certainty of success.</p>

<p>And those who might have offered an effective resistance
were lulled in fancied security or indifferent.
It is easy to talk now, half a century after the event,
but in 1860 the ties that bound the Pacific to the
Government at Washington were nowhere very strong.
The relation meant an enormous loss to California.
For all the immense tribute paid, the meager returns
consisted of a few public buildings and public works.
Besides thousands were tired of being ruled from a
distance of thousands of miles. The “Republic of the
Pacific,” that we intended to organize as a preliminary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
would have been well received by many who
later were most clamorous in the support of the Federal
Government.</p>

<p>Everything was in readiness by the middle of January,
1861. It only remained to strike the blow.</p>

<p>General Albert Sidney Johnston was in command of
the military department of the Pacific. He had graduated
from West Point in 1826 and saw seven years of
active service on the frontier, especially in the famous
Black Hawk war. He resigned from the service on
account of his wife’s failing health, and settled in Texas.
On the uprising against Mexican rule, he had enlisted
as a private soldier in the army of his new country, but
through the compelling force of genius soon became
commander-in-chief of the republic’s forces. At the time
of the annexation of Texas, he was its secretary of war.
When the war with Mexico broke out, he offered his
services to the United States, fought in many of the
severe engagements, rose to the rank of general, was
sent to Utah to suppress what was known as the “Mormon
Rebellion,” which he accomplished with firmness
and tact. In January, 1861, he was placed in command
of the Department of the Pacific.</p>

<p>Johnston was born in Kentucky but he always in later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
years spoke of and considered Texas his State. Thus
he had a double bond of sympathy for the South. This
was the man who had the fate of California absolutely
in his hands. No one doubted the drift of his inclinations.
No one who knew the man and his exacting
sense of honor doubted his absolute loyalty to any trust.</p>

<p>In all of our deliberations. General Johnston only
figured as a factor to be taken by surprise and subdued
with force. We wished him well, hoped he might not
suffer in the brief struggle, but nobody dreamed for
an instant that his integrity as a commander-in-chief of
the army could be tampered with.</p>

<p>One of the most brilliant members of the early San
Francisco bar was Edmond Randolph. He was a man
of rare talents and great personal charm. Born in
Virginia, a member of the famous Randolph family, he
was naturally an outspoken advocate of the South. He
was one of our committee, and on terms of social and
professional intimacy with every one of Southern leanings.
He was on the closest terms with General Johnston
and there is hardly a doubt that, purely on his own
motion, he approached the General with some kind of a
questionable proposition. What happened at that interview
no man knows, but Johnston’s answer made Randolph
stark crazy. He indulged in all kinds of loose,
unbridled talk, told several of our committee that he
had seen Johnston, that the cause was lost and otherwise,
in many ways, exhibited an incredible indiscretion
that might easily have been fatal to our cause.
No amount of warning was able to silence his unbalanced
tongue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span></p>

<p>This situation was discussed at several meetings and
finally it was decided that a committee of three should
visit General Johnston in a social way, not to commit
further folly by any intimation or suggestion, but to
gather, if possible, some serviceable hints for future use.
I had become prominent in council through my zeal and
discretion, and to my great joy I was named as one
of the three.</p>

<p>I will never forget that meeting. We were ushered
into the presence of General Albert Sidney Johnston.
He was a blond giant of a man with a mass of heavy
yellow hair, untouched by age, although he was nearing
sixty. He had the nobility of bearing that marks a
great leader of men and it seemed to my youthful imagination
that I was looking at some superman of ancient
history, like Hannibal or Cæsar, come to life again.</p>

<p>He bade us courteously to be seated. “Before we go
further,” he said, in a matter-of-fact, off-hand way,
“There is something I want to mention. I have heard
foolish talk about an attempt to seize the strongholds
of the government under my charge. Knowing this, I
have prepared for emergencies, and will defend the
property of the United States with every resource at my
command, and with the last drop of blood in my body.
Tell that to all our Southern friends.”</p>

<p>Whether it was a direct hint to us, I know not. We
sat there like a lot of petrified stoten-bottles. Then in an
easy way, he launched into a general conversation, in
which we joined as best we might. After an hour, we
departed. We had learned a lot, but not what we
wished to know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span></p>

<p>Of course the foreknowledge and inflexible stand of
General Johnston was a body blow and facer combined.
There was another very disturbing factor&mdash;the Comstock
lode.</p>

<p>While we were deliberating, that marvelous mineral
treasure house began to open up new stores of wealth.
Speculation was enormous. The opportunity for making
money seemed without limit. Many of the committee
were deeply interested.</p>

<p>Now it had been determined absolutely from the outset
that our ambitions were to be bounded by the easily
defended Sierra. We knew enough about strategy to
understand that it would be simple madness to cross
the mountains. That meant, of course, the abandonment
of Nevada.</p>

<p>This had been accepted with resignation when the
great mines were considered played out. But when it
became apparent that the surface had been barely
scratched and that secession might mean the casting
aside of wealth beyond the dreams of avarice, then patriotism
and self-interest surely had a lively tussle. If
Nevada could have been carried out of the Union along
with California, I am almost certain that the story of
those times would have been widely different. We certainly
had the organized forces to carry out our plans.</p>

<p>That’s the only way I can size up what followed.
The meetings began to lack snap and enthusiasm. Just
when we should have been active and resolute, something
always hung fire.</p>

<p>The last night we met, the face of our General was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
careworn. After the usual oath, he addressed the committee.
It was plain, he said, that the members were
no longer of one mind. The time had now come for
definite action, one way or another. He proposed to
take a secret ballot that would be conclusive.</p>

<p>The word “yes” was written on thirty slips of paper;
likewise the word “no.” The slips were jumbled up
together and were placed alongside of a hat in a recess
of the large room. Each member stepped forward and
dropped a slip in the hat. “Yes” meant action; “no”
disbandment. When all had voted, the General took
the hat, opened the ballots and tallied them; then threw
everything in the fire. “I have to announce,” he said,
“that a majority have voted ‘no’. I therefore direct that
all our forces be dispersed and declare this committee
adjourned without day.”</p>

<p>Not another word was spoken. One by one the
members departed. All I can say is that they kept their
secret well.</p>

<p>Two days later, all the various bands had been paid
off and dispersed. The “great conspiracy,” if you wish
to call it so, had vanished into the vast, silent limbo of
the past.</p>

<p>Only the General knew the extent of the disbursements.
My own impression is that they far exceeded a
million dollars. I contributed $100,000 myself, which,
of course, was an incident of the financial recklessness
of youth.</p>

<p>Many of the committee rose to great social and public
prominence. The “General” died not so long ago,
full of years and honors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span></p>

<p>Besides myself, there is one survivor, whose name
would surprise the nation.</p>

<p>(Since the above was first printed, this survivor has
died.)</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Randolph Betrayed Conspiracy for Revolt in California,
and Wrote Letter to Lincoln that
Caused Johnston’s Removal.</span></span></h2>

<p>I could not close this phase of the story without
further reference to Edmond Randolph, for I sincerely
want to set him right. I said he went mad. Everything
later proved it. He not only committed the
gravest indiscretions, but in addition he, a Southern
man, with a couple of centuries of Southern traditions
behind him, actually wrote a letter to President Lincoln
warning him of a vast conspiracy to carry California
out of the Union and questioning the trustworthiness
of General Johnston. Nothing but downright
lunacy could have inspired the act. This was
sent to President Lincoln by pony express and
reached him just about the day of his inauguration.
The story has been often printed before or I would
not revive it now. Its accuracy has indeed been questioned
by Randolph’s friends. I am inclined to believe
it true.</p>

<p>As a consequence General E.&nbsp;V. Sumner was sent
on a tug from New York with sealed orders and
placed on board a Pacific Mail steamer in midocean.
On the steamer the orders were opened. They directed
him to proceed to San Francisco and relieve
General Johnston of the command of the Department<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
of the Pacific. History relates further that General
Sumner was taken from the steamer by a Government
vessel outside the Golden Gate, hurried to Alcatraz,
where General Johnston had headquarters, and, in a
sensational manner, relieved him of his command.</p>

<p>The latter part is purest fiction. General Johnston
never had headquarters on Alcatraz. He lived with
his family on Rincon Hill, near the residence of Louis
Garnett. Sumner arrived in San Francisco on the
steamer, publicly, like anyone else. General Johnston,
informed of his arrival, at once arranged for a
conference and the two met in perfect amity at the
old army headquarters, located on Bush street, if I
recollect aright. The transfer of authority took place
the next day. There are abundant living witnesses
to these facts. General Johnston’s resignation was
in President Lincoln’s hands long before Sumner
reached California and the same was accepted a few
weeks later.</p>

<p>One of General Sumner’s first acts was to order
arms from the arsenal and organize patriotic citizens
for an expected crisis. But they were simply fighting
windmills. The real crisis had disappeared of itself
two months before, through General Johnston’s
firmness&mdash;and the Comstock lode.</p>

<p>As a further proof of Randolph’s madness, he
straightway developed into an outspoken, rabid secessionist,
made speeches of the most inflammatory
nature and it was highly significant that he escaped imprisonment
in Alcatraz. He died within the year, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
physical and mental wreck. In my humble judgment
he deserves sincere pity, not blame.</p>

<p>That some one of important station wrote a mysterious
letter to President Lincoln which caused the retirement
of General Johnson is beyond dispute.</p>

<p>One of the versions of the story has never been
published, to my knowledge. In 1880, when Mr.
Justice Field was candidate for President, he flooded
the South with literature concerning his friendship
for that section, as evidenced by various decisions
of the United States Supreme Court in the dark days
of reconstruction. In the North, principally among
the Grand Army, a pamphlet was circulated to the
effect that he had saved California to the Union by
a timely letter to President Lincoln, which resulted
in General Sumner’s hasty mission. Whether it was
authorized by Judge Field, I do not know. But it fell
into the hands of the Southern leaders and doomed
his candidacy in the section where he counted on
support. Not at all because he had saved the Union,
but because of the implied aspersion on the memory
of one who will ever be dear to the South&mdash;a gentleman
of unimpeachable honor, a great soldier who
died a soldier’s death, fighting for the Lost Cause.</p>

<p>After he resigned, General Johnston earnestly advised
many Southerners, some of them still alive, to
do nothing that would bring war to California. “If
you want to fight, go South,” was his constant counsel
to all. Many followed his advice. Hundreds,
perhaps thousands, of them were cut off by Indians
in Arizona, where the savages had full swing, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
the frontier army posts having been abandoned.
General Johnston stayed in California till his State&mdash;Texas&mdash;seceded.
Then with a few followers he traversed
the savage wilderness and after many adventures
reached the South.</p>

<p>There is a rather pathetic sidelight to the story that
illustrates the simple devotion of the old-time slaves
to their white masters. General Johnston had freed
all his slaves before he came to California. One of
them, called “Rand,” brief for “Randolph”&mdash;he had
no other name&mdash;followed him as a body-servant to
the Pacific. When Johnston left for the South he
ordered “Rand” to stay behind. He was a famous cook
and could have commanded big wages in a high-class
restaurant. But the faithful body-servant would not
be denied. He fought his way with his former master
through the Apaches of Arizona and was with
him at Shiloh when he died. He hung over the dead
body of the fallen leader in a wild passion of primitive
grief.</p>

<p>Later some hundred colored body-servants of General
Johnston’s appeared at various parts of the
South. The real “Rand” settled in Louisville, where
he was an object of solicitous regard on the part
of the Johnston family and others of the old regime.</p>

<p>“Rand” proved himself no less great in peace than
war, for he married a widow with seven children, an
act that needed moral courage of the highest sort.
His career was somewhat checkered, but he was always
well looked after, and “looking after” “Rand”
was often quite a job.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span></p>

<p>He became something of a character in the border
city; resolutely declined to be “reconstructed” and
remained an unrepentant rebel to the last. He was
very bitter in his talk about the “poor white trash”
of the North. When he uncorked the vials of his
wrath he called his adversary an “abolitionist” as the
last word of scorn.</p>

<p>In his final illness tender Southern hands smoothed
his way into the hereafter. Mrs. H.&nbsp;P. Hepburn of
Louisville, once of San Francisco, was present when
the curtain rang down on “Rand.” He raised his
feeble head and said: “I’se ’gwan to meet ole Marse
Johnston,” then sunk back on the rough pillow, closed
his eyes and died.</p>

<i>Southerners in California Form Plan to Intercept Gold
Shipments on Pacific Mail Liners from San Francisco
to Capital.</i></span></h2>

<p>I was broken-hearted at the turn of affairs in California.
Needless to say, I was one of those who
voted “yes” on the memorable night when the committee
disbanded. The actions of General Sumner,
which were needlessly severe and autocratic, tended
to make the tension more severe. Just for some idle
expression of sympathy for the South, all sorts of
really inoffensive people were clapped into Alcatraz
and subjected to indignity and loss. President Lincoln
later on realized that Sumner was only making
matters worse and sent General Rice to relieve him,
who at once adopted a policy more pacific and wise.</p>

<p>But this is no part of the story. The idea of interrupting
the gold shipments by the Pacific Mail, very
essential to the Government at Washington, again
took form. This was to be effected by seizure on the
high seas. A number of prominent men were interested
and I was requested to become one. I had
no stomach for downright piracy, though ready for
any risk. I stipulated that I must first receive a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
regular commission from the Confederate Navy. This
being agreed to, the sum of $250,000 was subscribed,
of which $50,000 was mine.</p>

<p>In company with H.&nbsp;T. Templeton, a well-known
Californian, later a familiar of the Crocker family,
we traveled by steamer to Acapulco. Mexico was
then in an uproar over the threatened French invasion.
The American Consul, a son of John A.
Suter, advised us that it was little short of madness
to cross the country to Mexico City, which we gave
as our destination. But Templeton was brave as a
lion and I was young, reckless and confident in my
luck. Heavily armed, with a single guide, who, by
the way, fled in terror at the first sight of danger, we
set out on a venturesome journey.</p>

<p>That trip would make some story by itself. We
had several pitched battles with small bands of “ladrones”
or robbers. Once both our horses were shot
from under us. My previously acquired knowledge
of Spanish stood us in good stead in securing fresh
equipment, knowledge of the way and sometimes hospitality,
and shelter. Finally, after great hardships
and danger we reached Mexico City, and thence proceeded
without incident to Vera Cruz, which was a
sort of rendezvous for blockade runners. Here Templeton
and I parted company with mutual regrets.
He took a ship for New York and returned to California.
I boarded a blockade runner and during a
rainy night we slipped past the Federal warships into
Charleston.</p>

<p>I had no difficulty in reaching Richmond, Virginia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
the Confederate capital. It was a vast, hustling,
military camp. Troops were marching and counter-marching,
officers on horseback dashing to and fro on
mysterious missions and everywhere the atmosphere
of war.</p>

<p>It was a couple of days before I saw President
Jefferson Davis. I laid my plans before him fully,
to his great interest, and later we had several interviews.
He did not come to a swift conclusion. To
my way of thinking at the time he was over-deliberate
in making up his mind. That was a youthful
illusion. I think of him now as a very great man, lacking
only one thing&mdash;luck.</p>

<p>He fully realized the importance of shutting off
the great gold shipments to the East from California.
President Davis said it would be more important
than many victories in the field. At the same time,
he saw grave difficulties in the way. He did not believe
that a vessel could be outfitted for the purpose
in any of the Pacific ports without arousing suspicion,
disclosure and capture. He warned me that my associates
and myself were taking an awful risk, almost
sure to result in ultimate disaster. Moreover, he was
uncertain whether under any circumstances the enterprise
could be justified under international law and
whether the proceeding would not fall under the
head of piracy, against which he resolutely set his
face.</p>

<p>All these questions were submitted to one of his
Cabinet officers, Judah P. Benjamin. Mr. Benjamin
was of Jewish ancestry and one of the ablest men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
who guided the way of the Confederacy. After the
general breakup, he escaped to England, became a
leader of the bar of London, counsel to the Queen
and won the highest honors of his profession before
he died. This distinguished gentleman examined with
great care the questions involved, particularly on the
piracy point, and he gave an opinion that it would be
entirely within the scope of international law to
equip and sail a vessel out of any port of the United
States provided no overt act against commerce were
committed before a foreign port was reached, letters
of marque exhibited there and the open purpose of those
in command declared. So for what followed I had at
least the advice of eminent counsel and I still believe
that the advice was absolutely sound.</p>

<p>In due course of time I received a commission as a
captain in the Confederate Navy. I had never been
on a man-of-war in my life, but that made no difference.
A fresh water naval hero may be as good as
the salt water kind. Also I received letters of
marque in blank, the names to be filled in when the
vessel reached a foreign port. Besides that I was
intrusted with quite a bundle of mail, addressed to
leading Southerners in California and doubtless of a
highly compromising character.</p>

<p>This literary consignment nearly got not only myself
but many other people into a peck of trouble,
which I might as well tell of now, although it is
somewhat ahead of my story. Returning to California,
liking not the route through Mexico, I had the
blockade runner land me at Aspinwall, where I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
joined the passengers of a Pacific Mail liner and
embarked at Panama for the run north. As we were
approaching San Francisco I became uneasy about
my documents, fearing that enough about my movements
might be known to cause a close personal
search.</p>

<p>On board the steamer was a lady long famous in
California, Mrs. Charles S. Fairfax. Her husband
was the lineal Lord Fairfax of the British peerage.
She was a niece of John C. Calhoun, a woman of
great beauty, wit and resourcefulness and an intense
Southern sympathizer. We became rather confidential
on the way up and I told her about the package
and my fears.</p>

<p>“Why, what stupid fools men are, anyhow,” she
laughed, “give that package to me and set your mind
at rest.” The suggestion looked good, for, of course,
I could assume responsibility if the documents were
found. That night Mrs. Fairfax left her door just a
bit ajar and as I passed it something was slipped to
her. No one saw the transfer.</p>

<p>When we reached San Francisco what I feared
came true. Not alone my luggage, but my person
were subjected to a search that hardly overlooked my
soul. While I was in the hands of the minions of the
law, who seemed sadly disappointed over their fruitless
quest, Mrs. Fairfax swept by in her stately way;
all the same I seemed to catch a twinkle of humor
in her eye.</p>

<p>Two days later, the lady handed me the package.
The seals were broken, but the contents intact. “You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
gave me a lot of bother,” said the lady, “I had to sit
up all night sewing these wretched papers in my
dress. What was worse still, I never dared to change it.
Just imagine what the other women thought of me.”</p>

<p>I passed the letters around to various leading lawyers,
bankers, financiers, and so on. Without mentioning
any names I told them how near they came to
falling into Federal hands. Many a cheek paled and
jaw dropped as they heard the story.</p>

<p>We have been told much of what women did for
the North, very little of what the women did for the
South. That is a noble and inspiring story that remains
to be told.</p>

<p>But to return to Richmond. The Confederate
cause seemed at its zenith. Everywhere was abounding
confidence in the final result. And now came a
whisper that a great battle would soon be fought that
ought to be decisive. I was eager to see something
of the war game and with letters from the Secretary
of War, hurried westward, arriving at Corinth, Miss.,
on April 4, 1862. Here a small Confederate army
was assembled under the same Albert Sidney Johnston,
not exceeding 5,000 men. Nine miles away,
General Grant was encamped at Shiloh with 35,000
men, confidently awaiting the arrival of General Buell
with 30,000 more, to begin the invasion of the South.</p>

<p>At the risk of criticism by experts I am going to
tell briefly what a great, old-fashioned battle seemed
like to a raw looker-on.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">The Great Battle of Shiloh and the South’s Irreparable
Loss in the Death of General Johnston.</span></span></h2>

<p>War, fifty years ago, was bad enough, but it wasn’t
the plain, cold-blooded deviltry that it is to-day. When
men met face to face and leaders led, in fact as well as
theory, I can understand the inspiration, the enthusiasm,
the wild love of glory, that invited the best blood to a
military life. But now, when victories are to be won by
pressing buttons, switching on or off electric currents
or dropping bombs from the sky on the heads of helpless
women and children, while it may attract those of
a mechanical turn of mind, it has ceased to be a business
that should interest a gentleman.</p>

<p>My recollection is of the old fighting days. I said
that when I arrived in Corinth on April 4, 1862, not
more than five thousand men were assembled there. But
all that night and the next day troop trains were unloading
enormous reinforcements and some were arriving
by forced marches on foot. By the night of April
5, between twenty-five and thirty thousand soldiers were
in camp, the flower of the fighting army of the South.
General Albert Sidney Johnston, with his heroic figure
and magnetic presence, roused the men to a height of
martial exultation very hard to describe. Everyone
knew that a great battle was impending. Most of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
guessed that the morrow would be the day. But they
hardly seemed able to wait. They were like war dogs
tugging at the leash, confident in themselves, confident
in their cause. One would have thought they were
bound for a holiday excursion instead of a death grapple
from which many would never emerge.</p>

<p>Very much to my disappointment, I was assigned to
the staff of General Beauregard, second in command. I
had hoped to be with General Johnston, where the fighting
would be the fiercest. Nevertheless, I had enough.</p>

<p>The troops retired at an early hour on the night of
April 5. But in the darkness flitted shadows of alert
men, making busy preparations for a great event. At
two o’clock in the morning, the troops were roused from
their sleep, had hasty refreshment in the darkness, and
then fell in, company after company, like so much clock
work, and the march to Pittsburg Landing, or Shiloh,
nine miles away, began. The infantry was well in front,
separated by perhaps half a mile from the artillery and
more noisy equipment.</p>

<p>The nature of the country was admirable for a secret
movement. It was well wooded, with abundant cover
to screen our presence, and it seemed almost uncanny
how the thousands of men marched forward with scarce
noise enough to stir the early morning air. Not a word
was spoken.</p>

<p class="captionl">[Reproduced from an<br />

<p>It was just daylight when we drove in the Federal
pickets. Before us lay the army of General Grant. It
seems to me that it was not more than two hundred
yards away. Breakfast was being cooked, the officers
and men totally off their guard. Nothing in the nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
of surprise could be imagined more terrible and complete.
Quick commands were given, there was a rattle
of musketry, the “rebel” yell rang out&mdash;a sound that
might well start the resurrection of the dead&mdash;and the
next instant I saw what appeared a long line of racing
apparitions in gray, with fixed bayonets, clear the intervening
space and fall like a cloudburst on the men in
blue.</p>

<p>Nothing saved the army of General Grant from utter
destruction but the presence of several gunboats in the
Tennessee river. These were splendidly handled, and
the fire was deadly and precise. It gave the Union
forces an opportunity to recover somewhat and put up
a gallant fight. Field artillery was concentrated on the
gunboats. Sharpshooters climbed into nearby trees and
picked off the gunners at their posts. The fire became
less frequent, less precise.</p>

<p>Anyone could see the line of General Johnston’s strategy.
Grant’s army was encamped on rising ground beyond
the Tennessee. Behind it the ground fell off rather
abruptly to a narrow plain along the river bank, beyond
which was no retreat. The object of the attack was to
force the Federal line to the river bank and then drive
in the wings until the Union army became a huddled
mass on the low ground where it could not fight effectively,
and be at the mercy of artillery fire. Then it
must either surrender or be wiped out. The first step
was accomplished by the initial bayonet charge. The
second required more time.</p>

<p>The battle raged into the afternoon. The field was
covered with dead and dying, but the strategy of General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
Johnston was rapidly bearing fruit. The gunboats
were almost silenced, the Federal columns showed apparent
signs of disintegration. Another hour would
have seen a total rout. General Johnston had been
everywhere, the directing genius, exposing himself to
needless dangers. Just in the moment of triumph, he
fell headlong from his horse.</p>

<p>It seemed as if the news of this irreparable loss
spread through the army like wildfire and caused, not a
demoralization, but a general pause. Beauregard took
command, evidently under a great mental strain. To the
surprise of many, he gave orders to retire. I heard
him say: “To-morrow we will be across the Tennessee
river, or in hell.”</p>

<p>He had another guess. Early the next morning General
Buell crossed the Tennessee with thirty-five thousand
fresh troops, and all day we were fighting our way back
to the strong position at Corinth. The great opportunity
was lost.</p>

<p>Last Lord Fairfax in direct

<p class="captionl">[Reproduced from an<br />

<p>Thus I saw the bloodiest battle of the war and I
think the most decisive&mdash;far more so than Gettysburg.
Had Johnston overwhelmed Grant at Shiloh, met Buell
with an army flushed with victory, with no gunboats
to contend with, there might have been another tale to
tell. With Tennessee liberated, Kentucky and Missouri
might have joined the Confederate cause and influenced
the final outcome profoundly. When I look back at the
long series of mishaps and unforeseen misfortunes that
seemed to haunt the Lost Cause, I cannot but conclude
that God’s will was there. After many years of bitter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
recollections, we are all of one mind&mdash;that the outcome
was best for the country, and best of all for the South.</p>

<p>I saw General Johnston’s body on the field, where he
fell. The wound that caused his death was of a trifling
nature. A rifle ball had cut an artery in his leg. A
surgeon with a tourniquet could have stopped the
hemorrhage. But he never sought assistance. He stood
by his post like a true soldier, and slowly bled to death.</p>

<p>History has classed Johnston as a great military
genius. Years after, the Government of the United
States erected a shaft with a suitable inscription on the
spot where he fell at Shiloh. His tomb, with a noble
equestrian statue, is in New Orleans. Most of his direct
descendants live in California, the State that he saved
from the desolation of war.</p>

<p>Concerning the battle of Shiloh, I have better testimony
than my own. A score of years later, I met General
Grant in New York. Out of an acquaintance, an
intimate friendship developed. During his first financial
embarrassment, of which the world never knew, I
piloted him to a safe haven. Grant’s genius was entirely
one-sided. In matters of business, he was the veriest
child. He had tied himself up in Wall Street ventures
and was facing ruin when he sought my advice. I took
his account to my brokers, Henry Clews &amp; Company,
where I had a balance of nearly two millions to my
credit, and, by careful nursing, brought him out, not
only even, but ahead. The General and I often spoke
of Shiloh, and he admitted, with a soldier’s frankness,
that only Johnston’s death saved his command. He also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
added that he learned a lesson in war that fateful day,
the most important in his long experience.</p>

<p>In this era of good-will and reconciliation, when the
old boys in blue and gray are meeting in comradeship
on the scenes of their former struggle, why cannot
someone write a trustworthy and impartial history of
the great drama&mdash;the greatest of our national life&mdash;which
our boys and girls may read and learn the truth?
The text-books of our schools are still deformed by a
spirit of intolerance and prejudice, most unfortunate and
misleading in an age that has happily outlived the bitterness
that divided us in the past.</p>

<p>I did not return to California after my visit to the
seat of war until late in the month of July, 1862.
Everything seemed in regular shape for outfitting a privateer.
But again the Comstock Lode interfered. Speculation
was fast and furious. Of those who subscribed
to the fund of $250,000 to carry on the enterprise only
two remained steadfast, Mr. Ridgley Greathouse and
myself. Greathouse was connected with some of the
well-known families of the South and of California.
He was a man of unusual courage and determination.
We laid our heads together and decided to go ahead
alone.</p>

<p>At this point we gained an unexpected ally. As he
cuts quite a figure in this story, especially in the great
diamond hoax, I might as well explain the strange way
in which we met.</p>

<p>Mr. Alfred Rubery was a young English gentleman
of fortune and culture, with the roving disposition and
love of venture that was part of the make of high-strung
Englishmen of his day. Traveling in the South
just before the war, he had acquired an admiration for
its aristocracy. Thus happened something that seemed
paradoxical. Rubery was the favorite nephew of John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
Bright, the great English statesman and publicist. It
was due to his influence and leadership among the laboring
masses that England declined to interfere in favor
of the Confederate States when its industries were
ruined and the industrial classes starving, because the
cotton staples from the South, on which they depended,
were suddenly cut off. Thus, while John Bright, across
the Atlantic, was resolutely upholding the North, his
dear nephew in San Francisco was openly expressly
sympathy for the South.</p>

<p>Sectional feeling at that period was so intense that
the slightest word brought on a quarrel. One evening
Rubery met a young officer, Lieutenant Tompkins, stationed
at Fort Point, scion of a prominent family of
New York. Somehow the subject of the war was
broached. High words followed, and Tompkins made
a remark that touched Rubery’s honor. The latter simply
said, “You will hear from me, sir,” and left the
room.</p>

<p>The code duello was still in full force. Though a
cause of instant dismissal from the army, no officer
would hesitate for a moment to refuse satisfaction to a
gentleman who considered himself aggrieved. Rubery
sought a friend of mine and asked him to bear his challenge.
He was on the point of leaving for Oregon to
attend to some of my business. For that reason he
turned the young Englishman over to me.</p>

British publicist</p>

<p>Now, when a man chose his second, he placed his
life entirely in his hands. It became at once my duty
to examine certain details. The challenged party had
the right to name the weapons, and I knew Tompkins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
to be an expert swordsman. I asked my man about
his saber experience. He admitted that he had some
knowledge of carving ham, but as to carving anything
else he was as ignorant as a child. I tried him at pistol
practice and found that, with extra good luck, at ten
paces he could hit a barn.</p>

<p>To go into a duel under such conditions was downright
madness. I told Rubery that I could not suffer
him to be a chopping-block for a Yankee or to be coolly
potted while he was shooting at the sun. I advised
him that he must take time to practice with swords and
pistols. But the Englishman would not be denied. I
never saw a man so determined. He said he would
rather die a thousand times than survive an unresented
public insult. Having no alternative, I carried Rubery’s
challenge to Tompkins at Fort Point.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Tompkins referred me to his friend, Quartermaster
Judson, whom I met without delay. I found
he had little stomach for the duel, not because he or his
principal were afraid, but because they dreaded dismissal
from the service. He admitted that his principal was
in the wrong and asked if there were any reasonable
terms to adjust the difference. I told him I was instructed
by my principal to accept nothing but a written
retraction of the offensive language. “That is out of
the question,” said Judson. “We are wasting time. Let
us proceed to details.”</p>

<p>“Proceeding to details” was quite a formal function
in the code. Arrangements for the slaughter of a
couple of human beings were always discussed over a
bottle of wine, in a spirit of friendly benevolence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
Judson produced the refreshments, filled my glass,
handed it to me standing, left his own unfilled and sat
down.</p>

<p>Now, in Southwestern Kentucky, where I was raised,
gentlemen always drank together. To offer wine or
corn juice to an equal and not partake yourself was an
almost unpardonable affront. You might do that without
offense to an humble dependent, but not to one of
the same social rank.</p>

<p>I had determined that the duel should not take place
and was watching for any chance to spar for time.
This seemed to offer an “opening.” Of course, Judson
had not the most remote idea of being discourteous.
But I assumed to think otherwise. I looked as
indignant as possible, dashed the glass on the floor,
slapped my hat on my head and left the apartment before
the astonished quartermaster had time to catch his
breath. A few hours later my second, Captain Fluson,
a famous duelist, waited on Judson with my challenge.</p>

<p>I hope no one will imagine I am bragging. I took
not the slightest chance in sending the challenge and
knew it very well. No man was compelled to accept
a challenge without a full knowledge of the nature of
his offense. If a person wanted to fight you just for
his own amusement or because he disapproved of the cut
of your coat, no one was expected to humor him, and a
man of honor could properly refuse to consider a challenge
based on trivial grounds or even kick the bearer
out of doors. As soon as my second presented himself
to Judson, just as I expected, he asked to be
informed in what way he had given offense to Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
Harpending. My second explained the deadly nature
of the one-sided invitation to drink, according to the
usages of Southwestern Kentucky, whereat the quartermaster
laughed and said he was ignorant of any such
custom; that he had never had the remotest intention
of being discourteous and asked that this explanation be
given me before going further.</p>

<p>Of course, I had to appear immensely gratified. I
wrote Judson, expressing my entire satisfaction, apologized
for my own hasty conclusion, and asked him to
dinner. We had a jolly sort of time and over black
coffee we discussed the proposed Rubery-Tompkins
duel. Both agreed it was a shame to see two fine
young fellows fill each other with lead and decided to
co-operate to prevent it. We managed to bring the
principals together and after a lot of diplomacy on all
sides Tompkins agreed to a written retraction of the
insulting language, Rubery promising that it should
never be exhibited unless he were charged with cowardice
as a result of the billiard-hall incident.</p>

<p>Everything terminated in a dinner party and the
incident was closed.</p>

<p>Rubery and I, thus strangely brought together, became
inseparable. We were nearly of an age, both
crazy for adventure, both devoted to the South. It
was not, therefore, strange that I confided to him all
my plans of outfitting a privateer. When he learned
the details he became almost idiotic with delight.
“Now, we’re getting somewhere,” he cried. “Let me
be your associate and count me in to the limit.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span></p>

<p>That is how the nephew of John Bright became associated
with Greathouse and myself in an effort to
destroy the commerce of the Pacific Coast and how he
came to loom largely in what was known to history as
the “Chapman piracy case.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX.<br />

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Plan to Capture Gold Ships Develops, But Trouble
Follows Engagement of Villainous-Looking Pilot.</span></span></h2>

<p>The three of us&mdash;Greathouse, Rubery and myself&mdash;now
worked in unison. My first intention was to outfit
in British Columbia, but an agent stationed at Vancouver
was unable to find anything fit for our purpose.
We negotiated for the purchase of the steamer Otter,
owned in Oregon, but on a trial trip she failed to
develop a speed much greater than that of a rowboat&mdash;not
enough either to fight or run away.</p>

<p>While we were fretting over the delay a small deep-water
vessel came into port, after a record-breaking
voyage from New York. The ship was called plain
“Chapman.” Historians have seen fit to name it the
“J.&nbsp;M. Chapman,” for what reason I am not aware.
Probably it was a case of what literary folk are pleased
to call “poetic license.” At any rate, we considered it
a serviceable craft, in default of a steam vessel. We
purchased the Chapman from her owners at a reasonable
price, as it was winter and an outbound cargo was
not obtainable at that season of the year.</p>

<p>Our plans might as well be explained fully here. We
proposed to sail the Chapman to some islands off the
coast of Mexico, transform her into a fighting craft,
proceed to Manzanillo, exhibit our letters of marque
and my captain’s commission in the Confederate navy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
and then lie in wait for the first Pacific Mail liner
that entered the harbor, capture her&mdash;peacefully if
possible, forcibly if we must. All of this was in line
with instructions. Then we proposed to equip the
captured liner as a privateer and figured to intercept
two more eastbound Pacific Mail steamers before the
world knew what was happening, in those days of
slow-traveling news. After that we proposed to let
events very much take their own course. It was a
wild, desperate undertaking at the best, but we were
all of an age that takes little stock of risks.</p>

<p>Having our ship, other details followed rapidly
enough. We purchased two cannons throwing a 12-pound
shot. This was arranged by a Mexican friend
of mine, acting through a well-known business firm,
which was entirely ignorant of the nature of the transaction.
In the same way, we bought shells and solid
shot and a large quantity of ammunition. In those
days of adventure it was no uncommon matter for
corporations or even private persons to purchase armament
on a considerable scale, without comment. Often
remote investments had to be protected not only with
armed men but also with a show of artillery. Our
Mexican friend merely had to say that he needed the
military supplies to guard a mining property in his
own country. As a matter of fact, he never knew
what the war material was intended for&mdash;just took it
for granted that he was doing something in the line
of accommodation.</p>

<p>Also we bought a large assortment of small arms,
rifles, revolvers and cutlasses. Everything was heavily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
boxed and marked “machinery.” We laid in, also, to
avoid suspicion, a small line of general goods of a kind
salable in a Mexican port, and an extra supply of
provisions.</p>

<p>We engaged an ordinary crew of able seamen and
without much difficulty selected twenty picked men&mdash;all
from the South, of proved and desperate courage.
These were to constitute our working force. They
were not known to each other, did not even know the
nature of the service&mdash;further than that it meant fighting
and plenty of it&mdash;somewhere in Mexico.</p>

<p>All our plans were perfected. It only remained to
secure a navigator who could be implicitly trusted.
Men of the South did not have much practical experience
in seamanship. Several of our confidential friends
scoured the town for a suitable person for this all-important
post.</p>

<p>Finally a man was brought to me by the name of
Wm. Law, guaranteed to be a competent navigator
familiar with the Mexican coast and a Southern sympathizer.
He was the possessor of a sinister, villainous
mug, looked capable of any crime and all in all was
the most repulsive reptile in appearance that I ever set
eyes on. From the moment I saw him, I was filled
with distrust. After a short general conversation I
dismissed him and told his vouchers that I could put
no faith in such an ill-omened looking character. But
time was pressing. No one else showed up and after
further guaranties, Greathouse, Rubery and myself saw
Law again and frankly gave him a general outline of our
plans. He accepted the responsibility with a well-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>feigned
eagerness; his tough-looking face seemed
lighted with a sort of demoniac exultation. There was
still another who shared our confidence to some extent,
Libby, the sailing master of the Chapman.</p>

<p>Everything was now ready to launch the enterprise.
Our clearance papers were secured from the custom-house
with a readiness that might have suggested a
suspicion to more alert minds. The “Chapman” was
duly certified to sail for Manzanillo with a cargo of
machinery and mixed merchandise.</p>

<p>It was on the night of March 14. Greathouse and
Law were to be on board at ten o’clock. Rubery and
I stationed ourselves in a dark alley behind the old
American Exchange Hotel. One by one, our fighting
men assembled silently, by prearrangement. The night
was dark, the sky overcast. We divided into three
squads to avoid attention, slipped through the dimly
lighted streets, past roaring saloons and sailor boarding
houses and reached an unfrequented part of the waterfront
unnoticed, where the privateer was moored.</p>

<p>Everything thus far had gone so smoothly that Rubery
and I were exultant. The wind, too, was propitious.
We figured to sail without delay, pass Fort
Point in the dark and be beyond the horizon before the
morning broke. We scrambled aboard the Chapman.
Greathouse was pacing the deck in agitation. Law
was not there.</p>

<p>I experienced a shock such as a man receives when
a bucket of ice water is emptied on him in his sleep.
The suggestion of treachery could not be avoided. We
cast loose from the wharf and anchored in the stream.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
But we were helpless. We could not sail without our
navigator. We had nothing to do but wait.</p>

<p>We scanned the bay for an approaching boat, but the
dark waters answered not. At two o’clock we turned
in for a much needed rest. We left a trusty man as
a lookout with orders to waken us at five o’clock if
nothing happened before. We still had a lingering
hope that Law might appear in season to carry out our
plans. And soon, as the hours glided by, the Chapman
rocked us to sleep.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">We Wake to Find Warship Near and Boat Filled
With Police Approaching.</span></span></h2>

<p>Somebody else slumbered on board the Chapman that
night besides the men below. Morpheus evidently got
a strangle-hold on our vigilant sentinel, from what followed.
I was wakened by a shake and a startled cry
from the lookout. I sprang hastily to the deck.</p>

<p>It was broad daylight. A couple of hundred yards
away I looked into the trained guns of the U.&nbsp;S. warship
Cyane. Several boatloads of officers and marines
were just starting from her in our direction. A hasty
look also revealed a tugboat making for us from the
waterfront, filled with San Francisco cops, headed by
I.&nbsp;W. Lees.</p>

<p>Of course, even had we been prepared, resistance
would have meant suicide, for the gunners of the Cyane
stood waiting orders to blow us out of the water. I
rushed down to the cabin, jerked Rubery and Greathouse
from their bunks and after a brief word of explanation
we proceeded to destroy as many incriminating
papers as possible. We made a hasty bonfire on
the cabin floor, burned a number of documents that
might not have looked well if read in open court, tore
into little bits and scattered the fragments of other
documents that resisted a quick fire and made a clean-up
in general. Smoke was streaming up the gangway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
when the naval officers and policemen swarmed on
board. Someone yelled, “They’ve fired the powder
magazine.” This made a diversion and gained a little
more time. Nevertheless, out of the destruction, Captain
Lees gathered together the scraps and by piecing
them together and guessing at the missing parts, collected
some evidence that was produced against us in
court later on.</p>

<p>Greathouse, Rubery, Libby and myself went on deck
and surrendered. We admitted nothing, contenting ourselves
with saying that we alone were responsible for
the ship and everything on board. They did not show
the least surprise as they searched the ship and opened
boxes containing our “knocked down” cannon and
stands of firearms. They saw vast quantities of powder,
shells and ammunition of all kinds exposed with
as much indifference as if they held a copy of the
ship’s manifest, which, in fact, they did have in their
possession, through the treachery of Law. If anything
further were needed to complete the knowledge that
he had betrayed us, it was furnished by an unguarded
remark of Captain Lees.</p>

<p>Our twenty fighting men, very much down on their
luck, were found in a foreward compartment. On our
solemn declaration that they were employed only for
service in Mexico none were prosecuted and finally all
were discharged with a “look out” in the future admonition
from the officer in charge.</p>

<p>Some effort was made to sweat the four of us. We
were cordially invited to step up like men and make a
clean breast. All these courtesies were politely declined.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
We only asked to be advised what we were
charged with, and the answer was sufficiently illuminating,
“Why, piracy, of course.” We were rather carelessly
searched, so far as our persons were concerned.
I was allowed to retain a small penknife, but one rather
important thing was overlooked. In those days everyone
carried a derringer, which looked like a sort of toy
pistol, but was really one of the most deadly close-range
emergency weapons ever invented by the evil
genius of man. Each person had a pet place for keeping
his derringer secreted, but handy. For myself, I
carried one in a specially prepared pocket inside of the
right cuff of my coat. Just a practiced twitch, and I
could have it in my hand ready for use in an instant.
This, as I said, in some way escaped the notice of my
searchers, so though I was a prisoner, I remained
fairly well armed.</p>

<p>All day long the wires around the world were telling
of the great Chapman piracy project, happily
nipped in the bud by the efficiency of Uncle Sam’s
government. One of the facts that gave it a peculiar
interest was because John Bright’s nephew was a participant.
The story did not lose anything by age or
travel. I had once a book of newspaper clippings
relating to the Chapman affair and a dispassionate
reading of the more lurid descriptions would have satisfied
anyone that Greathouse, Rubery and myself were
the most bloodthirsty pirates who ever cut a throat or
scuttled a ship.</p>

<p>We were taken to Alcatraz and later to the old
Broadway jail. Greathouse was released after a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
days of confinement on bail furnished by his relative,
Mr. Lloyd Tevis. Among the pleasant incidents of our
confinement were visits from Lieutenant Tompkins and
Quartermaster Judson. Our late enemies became our
best friends, brought us all kinds of necessaries and
refreshments, including newspapers, periodicals and
books, and in every way sought to cheer us up and
make our confinement less burdensome. Rubery, for
his part, returned to Lieutenant Tompkins his letter of
retraction, which the latter seemed very glad to receive,
for in those days no man of honor cared to
have documents of that kind floating around loose.
Such incidents of goodwill between men engaged on
opposing sides in the Civil War prove to my mind that
there was no fundamental line of cleavage, no real
antagonism, in fact, between the North and South, and
if there had been some power to steady the masses,
instead of lashing them to fury, there never would
have been a war.</p>

<p>As for Law, he had actually gone with us in good
faith up to a certain point, then had a case of cold
feet. It occurred to his sordid mind that a handsome
sum of money could be obtained from the Government
without any risk at all, by betraying his associates.
He made a cold-blooded, mercenary bargain with the
authorities through which he realized a small fortune,
disclosed all our plans, and our steps had actually been
dogged by detectives for days.</p>

<p>But the first day at Alcatraz I nearly landed Law.
I was locked in a lath and plaster room. I had not
been there long before someone began tapping on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
wall. After several repetitions, thinking it might be
Rubery, I asked, “Who is there?” The acoustics were
admirable. A voice replied, “That you, Harpending?
This is Law. I am under arrest. I want to tell you
all about the awful mishap that prevented me from
being with you on the Chapman last night.”</p>

<p>The voice of the wretch drove me to absolute madness.
I knew he wanted to draw me into admissions,
probably had two or three witnesses with him in the
room. I simply thirsted for his blood. As before
mentioned, the searchers on the Chapman had overlooked
a small penknife and a derringer concealed on
my person. My first impulse was to take a chance
shot at him through the plaster, but I thought of something
better instantly. With my penknife I easily
bored an opening in the wall.</p>

<p>“Law,” I said, “there is something I want you to
hear very distinctly and I don’t want to speak loud.
Put your ear to this hole I have made through the
wall.”</p>

<p>If he had ever put his ear to that hole he would
certainly have heard something very distinctly and much
louder than I intimated. Also, perhaps, this story
would not have been written. But if such a fellow
can have a good angel she was not napping that day.
Law did not put his ear to the hole and a few minutes
later I heard the door close behind him as he
left the room.</p>

<i>We Find Consolation in Lack of Proof Until a Foolish
Remark Causes Weakling to Turn Informer.</i></span></h2>

<p>As I said, Rubery, Libby and myself were brought
from Alcatraz to the Broadway jail, while Greathouse
was enlarged on bail. We remained there over six
months, while the Government was preparing for our
trial.</p>

<p>At that time there was published in San Francisco
a paper called the American Flag. It perished peacefully
after the war ended, but while it lasted, outclassed
every publication of the North in downright ferocity,
not alone to the cause of the South, but to every
person of Southern parentage. It demanded that we
be tried on a charge of piracy&mdash;a capital offense. But
the closest examination of the law proved that no such
accusation was tenable. The final indictment was for
high treason. That also used to be a capital crime,
but such a multitude of treason charges were brought
during the war that Congress stayed the hand of the
executioner and made the offense punishable only by
imprisonment and fine.</p>

<p>Even that charge might have come to naught.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
Against us was the accomplice Law, whose unsupported
evidence was not sufficient. The armament
found on the Chapman might have been intended for
a filibuster expedition against a Central American
State. The false custom-house papers might be explained
in the same way, also the secret preparations
for leaving the port, for the United States Government
was bound to intercept any illicit expeditions
against friendly powers. Some general literature of
an inflammatory “secesh” character was found on us,
but our natural inclinations were a matter of public
knowledge in San Francisco. Finally the scraps of
torn paper collected on the Chapman by Captain Lees
and pasted together, while incriminating, were not
complete and hardly admissible in a court of justice.
In other words, while there was an ocean of suspicion,
the prosecution could offer very little proof. Our best
friends knew that the indictment was true enough, but
to maintain it according to the rules of evidence was
another thing.</p>

<p>The needed testimony, however, was supplied through
some senseless talk of Greathouse. I have always contended
that a man’s worst enemy is his mouth, and
there never was a better illustration. Greathouse visited
us one day at the Broadway jail. He was handsomely
caparisoned, full of spirits and I think had just
risen from a good dinner, or rather lunch. Libby
asked him anxiously about our prospects. “Well,” said
Greathouse, “they are not exactly flattering. I guess
all of us will have to go to prison for a long term,
but,” he added somewhat grandly, “I will be able to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
buy my way out.” He didn’t say a word about the
rest of us.</p>

<p>This remark started Libby to thinking. He was
scared stiff before. Now he became a nervous wreck.
He knew that Greathouse was powerful enough to be
at large on bail. He knew that Rubery and I had
influential connections. He was himself a poor fellow
from Canada, adrift on the Pacific Coast, without a
cent or a friend. He saw himself made what we moderns
call the “goat” for the whole Chapman incident
and concluded that the wisest thing was to look out
for his own hide. Somehow I have never had it in
my heart to blame Libby overmuch for whatever
happened. My impression is that he intended to “sit
tight” until he thought himself left in the lurch.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, the day after the visit of Greathouse,
Libby sent for the United States District Attorney,
made a complete statement of all he knew concerning
the outfitting of the Chapman and our designs
against the commerce of the coast, adding, I am sorry
to say, some details that were false.</p>

<p>This confession, brought on as I believe by the foolish
talk of Greathouse, absolutely sealed our doom.</p>

<p>We were brought to trial on October 2 in the United
States Circuit Court, Judge Stephen J. Field and Judge
Ogden Hoffman sitting in bank, with an array of eminent
counsel on each side. It did not take long to
pick a jury in those days. The very dogs of San
Francisco knew of the Chapman case, yet the twelve
good men and true who swore they were unbiased
were impaneled in less than an hour. Some of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
were later noted. Here are the names: John Wheeler,
Jacob Schrieber, A.&nbsp;S. Iredale, Samuel Millbury, Joseph
D. Pearson, Joseph A. Conboie, G.&nbsp;W. Chesley, J.&nbsp;K.
Osgood, James W. Towne and W. P. C. Stebbins.</p>

<p>The evidence against us was overwhelming. Law
and Libby told their stories in great detail. About
half of it was rank perjury. They related conversations
that never took place. Also incidents that existed
only in their imaginations. Everything was set
forth in its blackest light. The witnesses were well
drilled and were not shaken by cross-examination. All
of the other incidents were proved, the purchase of the
ship through a custom-house broker named Bunker,
the purchase of cannon and arms, the false manifest
of the vessel and the assemblage of a considerable
fighting force. The Government also proved that Greathouse
and myself were citizens of the United States,
not of the revolted States, while Rubery was classed as
a common foreign adventurer. This, it seems, was
necessary to establish the charge of high treason.</p>

<p>Our lawyers made the best of a bad job. They
argued manfully many points of law concerning which
I have no recollection, except that they contended that
the mere loading of a ship with arms did not constitute
a crime any more than buying a pistol constituted
murder; that in order to constitute the overt act the
ship must sail for its destination. On this point the
court held that leaving the wharf and laying to in the
stream constituted “sailing.”</p>

<p>Finally our counsel made a grandstand bluff. They
declared that witnesses, then in Mexico, could clear up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
the whole transaction, but in the absence of these they
were compelled to submit the case without testimony.
None of us took the stand.</p>

<p>The lawyers unlimbered the usual forensic lore, illumined
by bursts of fiery eloquence. Both the judges
charged dead against us. However, Judge Hoffman
threw me the following judicial bouquet:</p>

<p>“For the accused I feel a deep regret, especially for
one of them who appears to have been animated more
by a zeal for the cause which he has unhappily espoused
than by the sordid and unworthy motive of
enriching himself by the plunder of his fellow-citizens.
It is to be regretted that the courage and willingness
to sacrifice himself for the benefit of his associates, a
slight glimpse of which has been revealed by the evidence,
have been wasted on an enterprise which is
indefensible in morals as it is criminal in law.”</p>

<p>It took the jury just four minutes to bring in a
verdict of guilty of high treason.</p>

<p>A few days later we were brought into court and
sentenced each to ten years’ imprisonment and to pay
a fine of $10,000. The county jail was named as the
place of our confinement until the Government of the
United States directed our imprisonment elsewhere.</p>

<p>As for Law and Libby, they were secretly placed on
board a ship bound for China by the United States
authorities, and were never heard of afterward, though
I took some pains to learn their fate.</p>

<p>So ended the famous story of the so-called “Chapman
piracy.” I have given the details at some length<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
because, while in itself rather trivial, it has been made
to cut quite a figure in history. The facts have been
so outrageously distorted that I thought it best for some
one having full personal knowledge of every detail to
tell the truth.</p>

<p>Libby’s first name was Lorenzo. People often ask,
“What’s in a name?” Perhaps nothing; but I think
otherwise. Lorenzo Libby helped to land me in prison.
Lorenzo Smith did me up in a business deal, and I
have unpleasant recollections of Lorenzo Sawyer, once
on the Federal bench of San Francisco. I never see
a man christened “Lorenzo” without an impression that
he will bear a heap of watching.</p>

<i>Amnesty Act Unlocks Prison Doors of Conspirators,
But Fails to Bring Security.</i></span></h2>

<p>In war times, the American Eagle was not a bloodthirsty
bird. We began to have sympathizers, even
among prominent Union men.</p>

<p>Greathouse was released after a brief confinement
under a general amnesty act and upon taking the oath
of allegiance. Rubery, a foreigner, could not take advantage
of the amnesty act. However, at the request
of John Bright, President Lincoln granted him a free
pardon. But the astute statesman arranged that his
precious nephew should not be involved in future
trouble because of his Southern proclivities. He was
placed on a Pacific Mail steamer and transferred at the
Isthmus to a British ship bound for England. We
had an affectionate parting, with the hope that we
might again meet, a wish that was realized in a dramatic
manner.</p>

<p>I alone was held, because it had been shown that I
had a commission in the Confederate Navy. In almost
exactly four months after my sentence, I was
brought before Judge Hoffman and ordered released,
under the same general amnesty act. The fine was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
likewise remitted. I am not versed in legal technicalities,
but it seemed to me that the learned jurist
stretched the strict letter of the law a bit in my behalf.
Be that as it may, I always held the name of Hoffman
in high esteem.</p>

<p>I was free at last, but only to enter into a new kind
of bondage. I was broke. The fortune I had won by
incredible good luck had vanished absolutely. What
was worse, my mine in Mexico was abandoned during
the French invasion and my title to it finally lost. It
yielded wealth to other owners later on. I never saw
my old chum Don Miguel Paredis again, but he kept
his money and cut quite a figure in Mexican affairs.</p>

<p>When I stepped out of Broadway jail I was outwardly
chesty, but inwardly depressed, for I had just
eight dollars and fifty cents to my name. Having
been a free spender at one of the leading hotels in
my capitalistic days, I went to the proprietor and
frankly made a clean breast of my impecuniosity. He
was overjoyed to receive me as his guest, gave me a
fine room and settled all my anxiety as to lodging and
three square meals a day. That was nothing out of
the common in the old days. But I would like to see
the photograph of a man with nerve enough to make
such a proposition to the manager of one of our first-class
hotels in the present generation.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>THE AUTHOR’S FATHER</p>

<p>A. Harpending Sr., a supporter
of the Union</p></div></div>

<p>Still my financial affairs gave me no little concern.
I thought of writing to my father for temporary assistance,
but there was an impediment even there.
While I was raising Cain, and wasting my substance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
for the South in California, my progenitor was one of
the strongest Union men in Kentucky. Some rather
crisp correspondence had passed between us on that
subject. Doubtless he would have been glad enough
to assist or welcome the prodigal. But I was too proud
to seek his aid.</p>

<p>This may justify a word of explanation. My father
was a lineal descendant of Baron Harpending, who
came to New York, New Amsterdam, with the original
settlers from Holland. It was one of his ancestors
who gave a lease for ninety-nine years to the
Dutch Reformed Church of a piece of property in the
business center of New York, now worth, approximately,
three hundred million dollars. It was another
Trinity Church case, with this exception, that there was
no doubt about the lawful heirs when the lease terminated.
My father brought suit to recover the property.
That was one of the great lawsuits of the last
century. Henry Clay, Daniel Webster and Judge Underwood
were my father’s counsel. He won the case
in the lower courts, but was vanquished in the Supreme
Court of the United States on a technicality by a four
to three decision. The family lost the vast property,
but the church still displays the Harpending arms, as
required by the lease of my ancestor, executed nearly
175 years ago.</p>

<p>My mother, on the other hand, was of the Clark
family of Virginia, which settled in Kentucky over a
hundred years ago. She was of the typical Southern
strain. Thus, while my father, with his Northern antecedents,
was an ardent supporter of the Union cause,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
I had the maternal blood in my veins. How we came
to take opposite sides in the great civil struggle was an
instance of plain heredity, nothing more.</p>

<p>But that has nothing to do with this story. While I
was worrying over finances, not knowing which way to
turn and mighty downcast and blue-deviled, I was
suddenly informed that my companion, Mr. Ridgley
Greathouse, had been rearrested and was in custody.
Ignorant of the charge and not having the wherewithal
to fly, to say nothing of inclination, I determined to
put on a bold front, walked down to the United States
marshal’s office and asked him if he wanted me.</p>

<p>The mental processes of that functionary were of a
leisurely nature. He looked me over with great care,
scratched his head with a pen in a meditative way,
slew a distant fly with a well-directed squirt of tobacco
juice and answered, weighing each word, “Well, not
to-day, but I guess I will to-morrow. Where do you
live?”</p>

<p>I gave him the name of my hotel and the number of
my room, which data being duly noted, we bade each
other good-day. To tell the truth, I was badly rattled.
Nothing seemed more certain than that I was doomed
to incarceration on a new charge, and, having enjoyed
the public hospitality for almost a year, I had no
stomach for any more.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>THE AUTHOR’S MOTHER</p>

<p>Mrs. A. Harpending Sr., an ardent
Southern sympathizer</p></div></div>

<p>Just as I reached my hotel, filled with these disturbing
thoughts, a friend asked me to go with him to
a business office. I sat down in the reception room,
while my friend disappeared in a rear office. I could
hear the sound of voices and the clink of gold. Presently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
my friend reappeared, carrying a small coin sack.
“Harpending,” he said, “you are certain to be arrested
on some sort of an accusation. The Yankees will never
let you stay at large. There are fifteen of us who have
subscribed a hundred dollars each. Here is the money.
We will also provide you a good horse and necessary
equipment. You must leave to-night.”</p>

<p>I asked the privilege of meeting my friends and was
accorded the privilege. Several were not overburdened
financially, and $1,500 was more than I could reasonably
need. I selected the three richest, gave each of them
my promissory note for $100, and returned the other
contributions. We talked more or less of plans. I
was advised to ride south to the neighborhood of Santa
Cruz, across the mountains to the plains, and journey
thence through the San Joaquin Valley to what was
then known generally as the “Tulares,” where such inhabitants
as there were came mostly from the South
and where, more important still, the law writs did not
run.</p>

<p>So, shortly after dark, I made my preparations and
proceeded to put as many miles between myself and
San Francisco as the means of travel would permit.
I turned down the horseback proposition, slipped on a
southbound train in the evening and before midnight
reached its terminus, San Jose.</p>

<i>Company of Soldiers Goes to Arrest Him; Is Taken
Into Camp and Very Soon After Everything Is
Fine.</i></span></h2>

<p>I stayed overnight at San Jose at the house of a
friend, a stanch Southern sympathizer, who had been
advised by wire that he might expect a guest by the
late train. The next morning bright and early I left
with a companion and a stout team for Santa Cruz.
On the outskirts of that town&mdash;pardon me, city&mdash;my
companion left me late in the afternoon, directing me
to a house of accommodation kept by a man I knew,
of strong “secesh” proclivities.</p>

<p>I passed into the waiting room, where a number of
men were standing. The proprietor received me with
evident agitation and invited me to a room upstairs.
“Mr. Harpending,” he said, “the sheriff has received a
telegram from the United States Marshal to detain you
if you pass this way. He will hear of the arrival of a
stranger, answering your description, as a number saw
you enter my house. But”&mdash;and here he ripped out an
awful oath, none of your feeble modern profanity&mdash;“I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
will send for some of the boys and we will have one
devil of a fight before he takes you.”</p>

<p>I could see that the man was capable of anything
desperate&mdash;I excused myself for a moment to get my
luggage, slipped down stairs to the waiting room, took
the small handbag that contained my personal belongings,
went out the rear door and took the road toward
Gilroy on foot. I hadn’t any plan in view&mdash;just walked
on well into the night until I was exhausted with
fatigue and lack of food.</p>

<p>“Youth will not be denied,” is an old saying. I
passed a house where the lights were still burning and
determined to seek a place of shelter. I knocked at
the door. To my astonishment and joy, it was opened
by a man called Clark, of Southern birth, whom I had
met several times in San Francisco.</p>

<p>Clark received me like a long-lost brother, roused
the household, had an old-fashioned Southern meal prepared
that made me think of home, and an hour later
I was sound asleep in a comfortable bed, safe among
friends.</p>

<p>The next evening Mr. Clark accompanied me to Gilroy,
where I was concealed in the hotel of a mutual
friend for two days, waiting for a southbound stage
that journeyed across the mountains to the San Joaquin
Valley and thence to Visalia in Tulare County.</p>

<p>There were two passengers on the stage when I
boarded it, a gentleman called Byington and his friend,
Thomas Staples. Byington’s son was afterward District
Attorney of San Francisco for several years. The
gentleman recognized me at once and as we traveled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
along I found that he wasn’t a half-bad secessionist
himself. He told me that he and his friend were bound
to inspect a mine in which they were interested at a
place called Kernville, about 125 miles southeast of
Visalia. He advised me that it was a notable locality
to “hole up” and avoid observation indefinitely; that
the “ville,” in fact, comprised only a few shacks, appurtenant
to the mine, which was just in the early stages
of development.</p>

<p>It was in the winter of 1864&mdash;the winter of the
awful drought when scarce a drop of rain fell in California.
The weather was like midsummer. The great
valley then only had a few straggling settlements. The
vast prospect was unbroken save when here and there a
miniature whirlwind in the distance raised a spiral of
sand skyward from the parched ground, or where a
band of dust-laden, half-famished sheep, staggered on
toward the mountains to escape from a universal desolation.
What a different prospect now. To one who
saw those unbroken solitudes, that are to-day among
the busiest haunts of men, with fine cities, railroads,
power lines, immense systems of irrigation, intensive
agriculture, oil fields&mdash;everything in short that goes to
make prosperity and a high civilization,&mdash;nothing is
more impressive of what a few brief decades of enterprise
can bring forth.</p>

<p>As there was a small military post at Visalia, when
we neared that town I made a detour on foot and
joined Messrs. Byington and Staples to the eastward.
We reached Kern without any noteworthy incident.
The place was exactly as Mr. Byington described it&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>a
collection of slab shacks to shelter a few men engaged
on development work on the mine. This was known
as the “Big Blue.” It was an immense ledge of bluish
quartz, and was enjoying a boom on the San Francisco
stock market. Byington was a type of the Californians
of the ’60s, who were ready to go into any mining
stock venture, almost to the extent of their fortunes,
without knowing anything more about the actual business
than so many cottontail rabbits. At his request, I
examined the “Big Blue,” and didn’t like the looks of
things at all. The superintendent raved about the richness
of the ore, showed us fabulous assays, but there,
staring us in the face, was a stamp mill that hadn’t
turned a wheel for months. I satisfied myself that
while there were here and there small bunches of ore,
sufficient to furnish seductive looking assays, the general
vein matter was far too low to be worked to a
profit. As for the outlook, that was another thing.
The mine might prove to be rich at a greater depth,
but the chances were at least 50 to 1 that it wouldn’t.
I advised Byington to unload his stock while he could,
which he did to his great advantage. A few months
later, “Big Blue” stock certificates weren’t worth picking
up in the street. Nevertheless, “Big Blue” was
the inspiration for several later mining camp crazes.
Among others, Senator J.&nbsp;P. Jones of Nevada dropped
a good-sized fortune in it.</p>

<p>I became known at Kernville, and as people were
traveling to and fro, it was certain that my retreat
would soon be common property to my enemies as
well as my friends; so I decided to seek solitude and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
efface myself. With three companions of a roving nature,
we struck out for the mountains and for some
time enjoyed the delightful, care-free bohemian existence
that cannot be found in many places outside of
California.</p>

<p>I hadn’t forgotten my old mining habits. One day
I picked up a number of fragments of quartz, broken
by the weather from a ledge that had a likely look.
I took these to our camp, crushed them in a primitive
way, “panned” the product and stood aghast with astonishment
at the result. A long, heavy “tail” of gold in
the pan told that the rock must be worth hundreds
of dollars a ton.</p>

<p>There is something about gold&mdash;just the metal&mdash;that
makes people forget everything else in life. A little
prospecting showed us that we were in the heart of a
great gold-bearing district, with surface croppings of
such value that all a man needed for working capital
was a pick, a pan, a couple of hammers and a mule to
carry the rock to water, where it could be hand-crushed
and washed. Even the mule could be dispensed with
if one did not mind the labor of shouldering an ore
sack for a short distance every day. We were rich and
gold-mad.</p>

<p>Realizing the importance of the discovery I sent one
of my companions to collect enough men to form a
mining district under the existing laws. These assembled,
we perfected an organization and elected officers.
Somewhere in the Book of Genesis mention is made of
a river in Paradise running through the land of
“Havilah, a country rich in gold.” We were shy on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
the river, but the balance of the quotation seemed appropriate
enough, so I christened the proposed town
“Havilah.” The district was called “Clear Creek,”
under which title it was famous for many a year. Also
I showed judgment and forethought in a real estate
way, claiming and staking off a natural townsite.</p>

<p>I didn’t dare to go down into the settled district to
purchase anything like machinery, for fear of arrest, but
we constructed rude arastras, primitive Spanish quartz
mills, and began to turn out gold bullion in astonishing
amounts. Something concerning a new gold discovery
began to leak out and occasional prospectors joined
our camp. We had no end of provisions, plenty of
fresh meat and sort of kept open house. All in all, it
was about the best-ordered mining camp I ever saw.</p>

<p>But the big boom for the camp came through my old
journalistic enemy, the American Flag. Word came to
it somehow that I was located in the mountains back
of Kern City, ostensibly engaged in mining. Straightway
it gave me a terrific blast, claiming that mining
was only a cloak for a new piece of deviltry I was
hatching. The effect of this was that it located me
for a lot of my Southern friends who really believed
that I was organizing a band to fight through to Texas,
and as a consequence they began to swarm into Havilah
in large numbers. Nearly all my fighting men of the
Chapman were among the first arrivals. Also several
Northern men, fired by the word “gold,” took a chance
of entering into an alleged stronghold of conspirators.
They would have marched into hell, just the same, for
gold. They had the same reception as anyone else.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
Far up in the mountains, away from strife and faction,
these men mingled in perfect amity and good fellowship.
It was another illustration of what I said before&mdash;that
if the people had been left to settle matters in
their own way there never would have been a Civil
War. Chattel slavery in the South was fast dying at
the root. Another decade or so would have seen its
finish. And the real question of slavery was not settled
at all. There have grown up other forms of slavery
far more odious and soul-destroying than the mild system
maintained, with very few exceptions, in the South.
It was the agitators and demagogues on both sides, who
never fought at all, upon whom must rest the responsibilities
of our war, just the same as in nearly every
other historic struggle. Strangely enough, these men
are commonly canonized, instead of being held up to the
execration of mankind.</p>

<p>Havilah was fast becoming a large proposition. Its
trade was eagerly sought for and pack trains of supplies
were arriving daily. But the more it grew, the louder
and longer raved the American Flag about the band of
outlaws in the mountains, headed by the piratical Harpending.
So specific were the denunciations that at
length they seriously attracted the notice of the Government.
Finally a detachment of troops stationed at
Visalia was dispatched to drive us out.</p>

<p>We had timely notice of this kindly intention. I had
been recognized as a sort of leader, partly because of my
position as the largest owner of the district, partly because
of the newspaper notoriety, which had given me
the character of a daring adventurer&mdash;the character that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
impresses the rough natures of a mining camp. All the
miners were called together. Lookouts were stationed
down the canyon to give notice of the approach of a
hostile force. I had decided to adopt Albert Sidney
Johnston’s strategy and try the moral effect of a surprise.</p>

<p>But the wily soldier in command did not come by the
usual route. Early in the morning we heard the sound
of cavalry tramping down the mountain side. We were
prepared for that. The officer and his troopers, about
eighty in all, walked into an ambuscade and suddenly
found themselves confronted by four times their number,
raw-boned, bearded, athletic miners, each armed to the
teeth. I stepped forward, saluted the officer, who seemed
a trifle rattled, congratulated him on being just in time
for breakfast and carelessly asked him if he had lost his
way.</p>

<p>The officer replied, in a surly fashion, that his business
was to disperse a band of cut-throats and rebels. I
answered that he could hardly mean us; that we were
peacefully pursuing a lawful occupation; that we were
ready to submit to legal authority, but must first know
the nature of our offense. I urged him to examine the
camp, interview some well-known Union men who were
with us and satisfy himself that we were neither outlaws
nor rebels. There was nothing for him to do but
make the best of a bad bargain. The troopers rode to
camp with their miner escort, had a jolly good breakfast,
with more or less joshing on either side, and that
part of the incident closed in a happy way. But the
officer declined to be comforted. He was clearly mortified
at our successful strategy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span></p>

<p>We all knew that this was only a respite&mdash;that more
serious trouble was ahead. But, in fact, it proved the
camp’s salvation. A gentleman called Sumner&mdash;I forget
his other name&mdash;a Northerner of character and standing,
who knew all about our case, came to our defense in
San Francisco. I also sent a full statement of our case
to my friend, Colonel Crockett, later a Justice of the
Supreme Court. These two waited on General McDowell,
in command of the Department of the Pacific,
and so far convinced him that he sent rather peremptory
orders to Visalia not to interfere with us further,
except on direct command.</p>

<p>At the same time I was advised that I was free to go
to and from San Francisco; that there never had been,
in fact, a charge against me; that the rearrest of Mr.
Greathouse was in no way connected with myself; that
the United States marshal had only been advised to keep
an eye on me; that he had only wired the Sheriff at
Santa Cruz to do the same.</p>

<p>Tn other words, I had fled from a man of straw&mdash;from
a lighted pumpkin head in a dark room&mdash;and had stumbled
over a fortune.</p>

<p>With sufficient money, I made haste to San Francisco,
paid my trifling debts, not overlooking the hotel
keeper; bought a quartz mill and appurtenances, rushed
it down the valley and had the stamps falling in record-breaking
time.</p>

<p>The year 1865 was a busy one for Havilah and the
Clear Creek mining district. It became a heavy gold
producer&mdash;miners, capitalists, speculators swarmed into
it from all over the Pacific slope. I laid out my townsite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
in due season and sold it out at fancy figures. The
main street brought an average of $20 per foot. A
boom was on all along the line. I was offered fancy
prices for my mining claims. I let them go. My principle
was to avoid what is vulgarly known as “hoggishness.”
When I could make a million by a business turn
I considered it a good day’s work.</p>

<p>But as a matter of fact, I only cleaned up with
$800,000. That is what I banked in San Francisco long
before the end of 1865.</p>

<p>The town of Havilah prospered mightily. At one time
it must have numbered nearly 3000 inhabitants. It was
a brisk center with hotels, livery stables, large merchandise
stores, lawyers, doctors, preachers, open gambling
houses, hurdy-gurdies, saloons, banks, bagnios and the
other evidences of advanced civilization.</p>

<p>Not only that, but its enterprising inhabitants appeared
before the next legislature and asked for the creation of
a new county. Though by that time a permanent resident
of San Francisco, I assisted in the passage of a bill
that cut off from Tulare the county of Kern, and named
Havilah the county seat. It so remained until the
decline of mining and the growth of agriculture in the
lowlands moved the capital to Bakersfield.</p>

<p>These statements can be verified by official records of
Kern county and of the town of Havilah, which I presume
still exist. Also by the testimony of many people
still living.</p>

<p>Such were the tricks Dame Fortune played me in a
period of a little longer than a year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span></p>

<p>I was literally chased from absolute poverty into the
possession of nearly a million dollars.</p>

<p>I discovered a great mining district and founded a
thriving town.</p>

<p>And if the matter of paternity is ever brought up in
court, it will probably be proved to the satisfaction of a
jury that I am the father of Kern county.</p>

<i>Realization Had Come That Mineral Riches Formed
Smallest Part of Resources; Outlook Was Bright.</i></span></h2>

<p>Late in the summer of 1865, I took up my residence
in San Francisco. The war was over, the country settling
down after the intoxication of a terrific struggle.
But one fever was only followed by another, so far as
I was concerned. I was barely 25, but far older than
my years. In fact, I never had any youth at all. From
the time when I ran away from college to join Walker’s
expedition against Nicaragua, I was called on to meet
problems that required a man’s decision, and so became
one, long ahead of time. But I was brimful of a restless
ambition to make my mark&mdash;to become one of the
great central figures in working out the destiny of the
Pacific Coast.</p>

<p>Those were stirring times, indeed. Few seem to
understand that the decade between 1860 and 1870 was,
next to the gold age of the ’50’s, the most important in
the history of California. It was the period of transition
from the fierce exploitation of the pioneers who
looked only on the region as a thing to be despoiled of
its treasures and to be abandoned. It saw the silent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
valleys changed to broad oceans of waving grain. It
saw the foothills crowned with thrifty vineyards, saw
the sure foundations laid of a great fruit industry, saw
the beginning of systematic irrigation. It saw the port
of San Francisco crowded with masts of vessels to carry
its new-found wealth to distant lands, saw a mighty
foreign commerce develop, saw the treasures of the
Comstock Lode unlocked, saw a railroad stretch from
the Atlantic to the Pacific. And men arose to meet the
new conditions. A splendid line of merchants seized the
opportunities of trade. Isaac Friedlander opened the
markets of England for our wheat. Macondray Brothers
built up great business interests in the Orient. The
trade mark of William T. Coleman &amp; Company was a
guaranty of their goods throughout the civilized world.
These names are only typical of many. A new race of
mighty miners developed, men like George Hearst, J.&nbsp;B.
Haggin, Lloyd Tevis, Alvinza Hayward, G.&nbsp;W. Grayson
and others, whose activities extended to Utah,
Nevada, Arizona, Montana and to distant Mexico, pouring
a fresh river of gold and silver into California.</p>

<p>The drift of population of the growing city also
changed and the westward movement began, which will
only be bounded by the ocean.</p>

<p>In short, nearly all we have in Northern California
to-day in the way of industries and enterprise can trace
the starting point to that age.</p>

<p>It was an intense, booming, hopeful decade, a period
of great events and great men, when everyone at last
realized that gold was the smallest part of the State’s
resources and the outlook as broad as the horizon of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
midocean. I do not wish to interrupt the narrative to
dip into general history, but it may interest the reader
to have a glimpse, as we jog along, of real things and
the live people of what I may be pardoned for calling
the old but recent times.</p>

<p>All old Californians can recollect the now faded glory
of Montgomery street. Stretching barely from the foot
of Telegraph Hill, at Jackson street, nine blocks, to a
full stop at Market street, it was really the whole town.
During the busy hours of the day you could meet there
every man worth knowing in San Francisco, and in the
afternoon, every woman with a pretty face or a handsome
gown to show. This gave a wonderful facility for
acquaintance and general good-fellowship. Everybody
knew everybody. That was what made the old San
Francisco the most charming and fascinating city in the
world from a social standpoint. It was not alone the
most brilliant society I ever encountered in an experience
that has covered most of the world, but there was
a freedom and heartiness in general intercourse that
could only be explained by the conditions under which
people lived.</p>

<p>Into those nine blocks, and, to a less extent, into one
block on either side of some of the intersecting streets
like California, Pine and Bush, a vast business was
huddled no less remarkable for its vast extent than for
its cosmopolitan, or rather heterogeneous character.
Banks, commercial houses, stock exchanges, brokers’
offices, courts, public buildings, the leading hotels, retail
stores, public libraries, theaters, music halls, the two
great social clubs, nearly all the lawyers in town, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
leading doctors and probably the finest saloons in the
world, were mixed up inextricably like a huge human
menagerie broke loose. Not to be on Montgomery
street, or within half a block of it, was to be classed as
a business, professional or social pariah.</p>

<p>Of course real estate values soared skyward. It was
hard to estimate what Montgomery street frontage was
really worth, but there were actual transactions as high
as $6,000 a front foot, nearly as high as the present selling
price of choice realty on Market street. Rents likewise
were enormous. Considering how little the landlord
gave in the way of conveniences to his tenants,
these rents were much higher than they are today.</p>

<p>To relieve this tremendous congestion was one of the
problems of San Francisco in the 60’s. No one had
the perspective to forecast cable and trolley cars climbing
all kinds of grades and peopling the hills with homes.
All we could see was an extension south and for that
purpose the city was badly laid out.</p>

<p>The battle cry in the early 60’s was “Montgomery
street straight.” The all but universal wish was to run
the great street, broadened to a wide avenue, in a direct
line to Connecticut street, far to the south. Tremendous
efforts were made to carry through this project in a
peaceful way. Several times it was near accomplishment,
but just as often fell through, owing to some
recalcitrant property owner. The main obstacle was the
large block of land on Market street where the Palace
Hotel now stands. This was owned by the Catholic
Church and had been reserved for the construction
thereon of a great religious edifice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as I got my bearings in San Francisco, I saw
at once what a vital question was involved and what a
grand opportunity was there to win not alone fortune,
but fame. I carefully surveyed the situation from every
standpoint and finally hit upon a scheme which would
carry out the original design of “Montgomery street
straight,” and avoid the opposition hitherto evolved.
As what follows forms one of the interesting bits of
San Francisco’s history, hitherto untold, and the city’s
present status was greatly influenced by my plans,
which, however, were only carried out in part, I will
give an outline of one of the largest real estate transactions,
of a far reaching character, ever conceived and
partly completed in the history of San Francisco.</p>

<i>Earthquake Plays Important Part in Big Deal; Timid
Citizen Sells Out in Hurry and Loses $350,000.</i></span></h2>

<p>In the early 60’s no one thought of Market street except
as a disfigurement to the city and a broad impediment
to its progress. It began almost nowhere, at an
unfrequented section of the waterfront, where the dullness
was relieved only by the arrival and departure four
or five times a day of a ferryboat owned by Charles
Minturn, which transported a few straggling passengers
between San Francisco and the small village of Oakland,
across the bay. If I recollect aright, the fare was 50
cents each way. It terminated&mdash;so far as traffic and
settlement were concerned&mdash;exactly nowhere, in the
desolate sand hills beyond where the Flood Building
now stands. The “gore” streets, like Post, Geary and
O’Farrell, that now pour a human tide into the city’s
big artery, were settled only for a few blocks westward;
beyond that there was solitude. The roadway of Market
street was an abomination even in the old days before
“good roads” became a slogan. The sidewalks, if any,
were wooden, and mighty poor at that.</p>

<p>I was about the first real estate investor, to which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
business I turned my attention, who realized in a sort of
vague way that Market street had a future. I had a
shrewd idea that the insistent plan for “Montgomery
straight,” on which so many based their hopes, was
doomed to disappointment, but as I said in the last
chapter, I saw a way out of the dilemma. With this
in view, I began to pick up Market street frontage from
First street west till I owned 800 feet. I also bought
the Sutter-street gore, where the skyscraper has since
gone up, at a public auction, paying $86,000 for the
same in hard cash, which was considered a top price.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I was quietly buying a solid block of land
straight through from Howard street to Market. It was
broad enough to allow a wide street to be laid out in a
line directly opposite to the ending of Montgomery, and
thus change so many backyards into frontages on a fine
thoroughfare&mdash;an extension of the city’s crowded mart.
I wasn’t a prophet or the son of a prophet, but the
enterprise looked good. Not only that, but it seemed
certain to me that the extension of Montgomery street,
once begun, either “straight” or at an angle, would be
pushed ahead by the force of public opinion to its proper
terminal, the waterfront of the bay.</p>

<p>Most of this immense property, outside of the Sutter-street
gore, was gathered in at prices so pitifully small
that they would test the credulity of the reader. Excepting
one other piece of property, the total investment was
less than $500,000, and the wretched buildings on it
yielded a net income of 1½ per cent. per month on this
amount. However, this was looked on as a very poor
return in those days when 2½ per cent. per month, compounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
with the regularity of fate, could be obtained
on well-secured loans. The money market was considered
easy when borrowers could be accommodated on
those terms. It all seems like some Monte Cristo story,
but let me tell the young, ambitious reader that there
are just as splendid opportunities staring him in the
face to-day just waiting to be taken into camp. The
region around the Bay of San Francisco is destined,
beyond a doubt, to become one of the greatest world
centers of population, commerce, business and production.
The possibilities have barely been touched. Take
it as the judgment of a close observer, with wide experience,
that now is the time to get on board&mdash;using, of
course, sound common sense and intelligent foresight.
If I were 25 instead of 76, I would like to give the
public an object lesson of how to make money.</p>

<p>But I was a long time securing the Market street
frontage necessary to carry out my plans. How I finally
succeeded is quite an incident, well worth recalling, although
it is ahead of my story.</p>

<p>On the south side of Market street, exactly opposite
the terminus of Montgomery street, stood a vacant fifty-vara
lot, owned by a well-known old pioneer by the
name of Selim Woodworth. I had bought sixty feet
adjoining the church property where the Palace Hotel
now corners. The Selim Woodworth lot was next to
that. Now the owner had a very hard head and a rather
top-heavy idea of the value of anything he possessed.
Off and on I was negotiating with Woodworth for more
than a year and a half, sometimes personally, sometimes
through a broker, but always ran abruptly against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
the same proposition. “If you want that property it will
cost you precisely half a million. There is nothing
further to be said on the subject. Let’s turn the conversation
to something else.” Nobody could have been
more courteous or more firm.</p>

<p>I had been bumping up against this brick wall so often
and was so helpless to carry out my plans without the
land in question, that I was on the very point of paying
what was then a price out of all reason or proportion
to existing values, when something happened to change
Mr. Woodworth’s estimates in a way quite novel and
picturesque, from a business standpoint.</p>

<p>The earthquake of 1868 wasn’t much alongside of its
successor of 1906, nevertheless, it was quite a jolt.
Some rattletrap buildings collapsed, many others were
cracked from roof to foundation, an immense number of
chimneys were overthrown and a few people killed. The
most disquieting feature was that the earthquake didn’t
know when to stop. There was the first big damaging
shock, but after that every ten minutes the earth gave a
jolt quite hard enough to send multitudes scurrying into
the streets. There was not an interval long enough to
allow the average man to gather his wits. After a night
of agony and suspense, most people were weak as kittens
and speechless.</p>

<p>I went down town in the morning after the quake
from my home on Rincon Hill. I really was not much
disturbed after the first lurch, for I had read somewhere
that the minor tremors succeeding the initial shock
never need be apprehended. One of the first men I met
in the business section was Selim Woodworth. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
carrying a handbag and his face showed evidence of
mental strain. I asked him where he was going.</p>

<p>“Where am I going?” said Woodworth. “What a
question to ask! Why, I am getting out of here before
the earth swallows me up. When do you leave?”</p>

<p>I told him I didn’t intend to leave at all, whereat a
look of deep craft came over Woodworth’s face. “Look
here, Harpending,” he said, “how about that Market
street lot? Do you still want to buy?”</p>

<p>I laughed as if in scorn. “Who on earth,” I said,
“would want to buy a lot that may be a hole in the
ground by night, reaching through to China. Besides,
you have always been so unreasonable that no human
being could deal with you.”</p>

<p>“Well, make me an offer, anyway,” he replied, “you
will find me reasonable enough.”</p>

<p>I pondered for a moment before I answered, “Well,
I was thinking of offering you $150,000,” I said, “but
that’s too much. Still, just to help you out in a
neighborly way I might strain a point and give you&mdash;”</p>

<p>I never had time to finish the sentence. “Oh, for
God’s sake,” yelled Woodworth, “don’t screw me down
at a time like this. Make it $150,000 and we’ll close
the bargain here.”</p>

<p>We shook hands on the spot. Together we went to
the Bank of California, where a formal contract for a
deed to the property was drawn, and this, at Mr. Woodworth’s
request, was guaranteed by a high official at the
bank. I deposited $150,000 in escrow. In due season
the deed was sent on to Mr. Woodworth in Europe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
was returned properly executed and the famous 50 vara
lot passed into my hands.</p>

<p>This is the veritable story of how I acquired the
frontage on Market street which enabled me to open
New Montgomery street through my property to Howard.
I was certain it would soon be extended to the bay and
solve the problem of the 60’s&mdash;“Montgomery South.”
At the Market street corners of the street I opened, the
Palace Hotel and the Merchants’ Bank, two of the finest
buildings in San Francisco, now stand.</p>

<p>I made New Montgomery street, as it stands to-day,
a free gift to the city of San Francisco, and it must
remain a permanent record of my existence. I may
add that I had to scatter numerous shekels among the
“boys” before the gift was finally accepted.</p>

<p>Also, the earthquake literally shook $350,000 out of
Selim Woodworth, which he would have received otherwise
in a few days.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Montgomery South Deal Comes to Notice of Ralston,
Who Buys Quarter Interest in Real Estate
Project.</span></span></h2>

<p>Long before the events narrated in the last chapter
a most important person became a character in this
narrative. In one way or another, I had become quite
a figure in the business world of San Francisco; I took
a flyer at several things in a speculative line, always
made money at my ventures, and was generally looked
on as what we now call “a comer.”</p>

<p>But it was entirely because of my large and peculiar
real estate investments that I attracted the notice
of the great central figure of California of that day&mdash;one
who always wished to be associated with any
of the large movements of his time.</p>

<p>Almost from the date when I first had money enough
to make it inconvenient to carry it on my person I kept
my account at the Pacific Bank, of which Governor
Burnett was president. But I had watched the ascendant
star of William C. Ralston as it put out of
sight all the lesser luminaries. I had a young man’s
admiration for his dash, energy and success and I
was pleased when I received a letter from the gentleman,
saying that he would like to see me, at my convenience,
at the Bank of California.</p>

<p>We met by appointment. I had known Mr. Ralston<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
before in a purely casual way. This was the first
time we had touched in business. He had a swift, offhand
fashion of saying pleasant things&mdash;not flatteries,
but things that put a man in good humor with himself;
and thus he spoke to me of his desire to be
abreast with the active men of the city, to be able to
aid and co-operate with them. Then he had a word
to say about my real estate ventures and in a very
natural course led up to a general conversation on the
subject.</p>

<p>Mr. Ralston’s manner entirely won my confidence.
Besides, we had a direct way of doing business then,
quite different from the dark-lantern methods of to-day.
I simply laid down my cards on the table, face
up. I told Mr. Ralston exactly what I had in mind;
that my purpose was to solve the great problem of
“Montgomery South” in a new way; that I considered
it a matter of vast importance for the city’s future and
one certain to bring fortune to the successful promoter.</p>

<p>Mr. Ralston listened with deep attention, with an
occasional word or nod of approval. When I concluded
he leaned back in his chair in a meditative way
and thought a minute. “It looks like a noble game,”
he said at length. “Now, how would you like me for
a partner?”</p>

<p>I was just a bit astonished at the proposition, but
I was gratified that the financial autocrat of the Pacific
Coast wanted to climb into my band wagon. The
arrangements were made with less “jockeying” than
now takes place over a thousand-dollar transaction. I
made a complete statement of my investments, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
Mr. Ralston accepted, and made me an offer based
on cost, plus a very handsome profit, for a quarter
interest. I accepted also in an offhand way and deeds
passed to correspond covering all my real estate involved
in “Montgomery South.” It was understood
that we would stand together to push the new street
through to the bay, and that in this project I should
have the practically unlimited support of the Bank
of California. Our holdings were merged into a corporation,
known as the Montgomery Street Land Company.</p>

<p>Thus I became associated with this strange character,
who has been dead almost forty years, yet whose
name is still a household word to thousands and bids
fair to be remembered long after those who pose as
the truly great are asleep in forgotten tombs.</p>

<p>I spoke of Ralston as a “strange” character. But
the adjective doesn’t fit the case at all. There was
just one Ralston in California. Perhaps his counterpart
never lived before. It would be far beyond my
powers to draw a sketch of a man so many-sided, but
here and there some traits cropped out so prominent
that they could scarcely miss the observation of a child.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>WM. C. RALSTON</p>

<p>President of Bank of California, the
first dupe in diamond fraud</p></div></div>

<p>Ralston had a marvelous head for business. The
most difficult problems of finance were as simple to
him as the alphabet and his mind cut through all perplexities
and obstructions straight to the truth. Had he
possessed a few less red corpuscles in his blood&mdash;been a
plain, downright financier, I am certain that he would
have grown beyond the narrow environment of the
Pacific Coast and become one of the world’s money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
kings. But he had an odd supplement to the cold-blooded
faculty of making money, a sort of richly
Oriental imagination that looked far beyond the mere
acquisition of a pile of cash.</p>

<p>For one thing, he had a passionate, almost pathetic
love for California. He wanted to see his State and city
great, prosperous, progressive, conspicuous throughout
the world for enterprise and big things. I think it
was this imagination, this ambition, that kept hurrying
him into one big undertaking after another, many of
which were way ahead of time. While he was stacking
up money in one direction, with the skill of a great
native-born financier, it was leaking out in various other
ways for rolling mills, vast hotels, watch factories,
woolen mills, furniture factories, and what not. It was
only an ambition to say that San Francisco had the
grandest and largest hostelry in the world that prompted
him to build the Palace Hotel. And so on down the
line. He tried to do everything, and, like others, failed
in the end.</p>

<p>With all of his tremendous business activities, I could
never think of Ralston except as a big over-grown boy.
He had an elasticity and buoyancy of spirits very seldom
seen beyond the teens and a youth’s eagerness in
the pursuit of pleasure. Nothing seemed to disturb his
imperturbable good humor. He was at once the best
winner or loser in the world&mdash;could pick up or drop a
million with equal gaiety and nonchalance. He always
smiled in conversation, but in moments of repose his
features settled into an expression that was half thoughtful,
half sad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span></p>

<p>Where he shone most perhaps was as a “mixer.” He
had wonderful manners, frank, cordial, magnetic, and
handed out the same quality to everyone alike. He
avoided, either by design or inclination, all the pomposity
and circumstance of greatness, even went out
of his way to be extra gracious to those who seemed
a trifle embarrassed in his presence. In this way he
endeared himself to a small army of young men and
to some of the still more youthful highbinders who
used to visit the Bank of California and stand up the
smiling financier for baseball club uniforms and other
all-important incidentials upon which the fame and glory
of California hung. As to the industrial classes, they
simply worshiped Ralston. He was their constant provider,
philosopher and friend. It seemed to me that
he knew half of the working population by their first
name, and he was known among them familiarly and
affectionately as “Bill” Ralston. It is a sad commentary
on human nature that in the hour of his misfortune
the men he had enriched took to the tall timber.
Only his humble friends proved true.</p>

<p>This only gives the faintest glimpse of Ralston. For
years I was his intimate associate. He was a man of
many friends and many business connections, but I
think he gave his entire confidence to only two men,
Maurice Dore and myself. In all our relations I always
found him punctiliously honorable and truthful,
and though the acquaintance was a costly one to me,
I hold his memory in affectionate remembrance&mdash;as I
did when I last saw him forty years ago.</p>

<p>And even admitting all that his traducers charge,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
after death had silenced his voice forever, I would still
say that he deserved a statue in Golden Gate Park as
the most effective friend the State of California ever
had. But before I close this story I hope to make it
plain that a cruel wrong was done his memory and let
the truth come out at last.</p>

This Chapter Tells How Great Panic Was

<i>Ralston Lays Foundation for Huge Fortune of D.&nbsp;O.
Mills by Making Him a Bank President</i></span></h2>

<p>Ralston had two business associates&mdash;I might almost
call them familiars&mdash;William Sharon and D.&nbsp;O. Mills.
D.&nbsp;O. Mills was a man of some fortune, worth perhaps
half a million dollars. He was about to leave for the
East to settle down somewhere under his own vine
and fig tree, when Ralston took him up. The latter
was just organizing the Bank of California, had no
ambition for titular dignities, and offered Mills the
place of president. He promised that the job would
be a sinecure&mdash;that he would do all the work. Mills
accepted. That was the foundation of his huge fortune.
But he was a mighty cautious speculator in those
days. He tried his hand at a number of ventures, sometime
invested large sums, but always required a guaranty
against loss. Strangely enough, this used to be
given him often, because of the conservatism associated
with his name. That, however, did not last long. He
became a bold, ambitious, original operator on his own
account. He had fine personal habits, but was just the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
opposite of Ralston&mdash;unemotional, cool-headed and austere.</p>

<div id="ip_131" class="figcenter" style="width: 272px;">
  <img src="images/i127.jpg" width="272" height="333" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>D.&nbsp;O. MILLS</p>

<p>First President Bank of California,<br />
a financier of national repute</p></div></div>

<p>Sharon was quite a different character. He was from
the same part of the Northwest as J.&nbsp;D. Fry, an uncle
of Mrs. Ralston, and so received a favorable introduction
to the famous financier. Ralston sent Sharon to
Virginia City during the early flush times as an agent
for his mining interests, and when the Bank of California
was organized and a branch located on the
Comstock Lode, Sharon became manager, a position of
great prominence and power. He was a daring, spectacular
plunger, though a very shrewd one, made big
money from the outset and with his general foreknowledge
of conditions really took no chance at all on great
stock market deals. With unexampled rapidity, he accumulated
a fortune of millions. Having no pet hobbies
to interfere with accumulating money, before the
’60s were over both Mills and Sharon probably possessed
larger fortunes than their chief.</p>

<p>As I have said Sharon’s personality was very different
from that of Mills in many ways. He had some
habits that an anchorite might not approve. Among
other things he was devoted to the great national pastime&mdash;draw-poker.
Many legends of his prowess, of
his bewildering bluffs and high-class technique were
long fragrant memories of the Comstock Lode. It is
related that a friend of Ralston with a moral turn
warned him that his agent at Virginia was a notorious,
abandoned and dissolute poker player. The banker listened
with absorbed interest. “Does he win or lose?”
he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span></p>

<p>“My information,” said the informer, “is that he almost
always wins.”</p>

<p>“Good,” said Ralston. “He’s the very man I want.”
The three were associated in many enterprises of the
first magnitude. They had combined resources, speaking
very conservatively, of not less than thirty-five millions,
which is a big bunch of money even today. They
formed an irresistible power in California, until the
railroad dynasty succeeded them. Still I have reason
to believe that Ralston never gave these associates his
full confidence, and that the relation became irksome,
if not oppressive.</p>

<p>I judge the former from an unrecorded incident that
ought to be remembered in financial history&mdash;an incident
that just prevented a crisis far more terrible than
that of 1907.</p>

<p>It was in the year 1869. Ralston had loaned the
railroad people some months before $3,000,000, with
which they pushed their line to Ogden, adding a hundred
miles to the Central Pacific in its cross-country
race with the Union Pacific for mileage. This large
sum had gone out of the State absolutely. Also two
millions had taken wing for South America to finance
an investment there. Things were already a trifle tight
when in July, 1869, Jay Gould’s famous “gold corner”
raised the yellow metal to a huge premium and the
gold coin of California was drained eastward, as
through a sieve. The banks always carried a large
amount of gold bars, but this was not available as coin,
for the mint happened to be shut down pending a
change of administration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span></p>

<p>The situation need not have been serious, for tucked
away in the United States sub-treasury were $14,000,000
in gold coin. It seemed the most legitimate transaction
in the world to deposit gold bars in the Treasury
and carry away an equal value in coin. But President
Grant, who was rather new on the job, for some unaccountable
reason absolutely refused to sanction the
transfer, although the bankers almost burned up the
wires with their appeals. An uneasy feeling was over
the town, the overcharged atmosphere of panic, apt to
break loose at any moment into a resistless storm.</p>

<p>While the tension was at its height I called at the
Bank of California one afternoon and was ushered into
the private office of Mr. Ralston. To tell the truth, I
was feeling the pinch myself, and wanted to know something
of the outlook.</p>

<p>The banker said I was just the man he wanted to
see. “If things go on as they are,” he said, “every
bank will be closed by tomorrow afternoon. Not one
of us can stand a half day’s run, and all will go down
in a heap. Then look out for hell in general to break
loose. This will happen if I don’t get a million dollars
in coin in the vaults tonight. But I intend to get
it, and want you and Maurice Dore to help. Be at
the bank at 1 o’clock tonight, and put on an old suit
of clothes, for you will have plenty of hard work to do.”</p>

<p>Dore and myself met by appointment shortly after
midnight. We were utterly mystified. Together we
tramped through the deserted, dimly lighted streets. It
seemed just like old times&mdash;the time we boarded the
Chapman to become privateers. We found Ralston at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
the bank with one of its trusty officials, still alive and
prominent in San Francisco. The financier was in high
spirits, but counseled caution. We walked noiselessly
to the United States Sub-Treasury, then located on
Montgomery between Sacramento and California streets,
where the Selby offices afterward stood. A dim light
was burning within. Mr. Ralston asked us to halt a
few paces from the entrance; then to our great surprise
he opened the door of the Sub-Treasury, without
challenge of any kind, and closed it after him as he
stepped inside. Presently he emerged with several sacks
of coin. “Take that to the bank,” he said. “The gentleman
there will give you something to bring back.”</p>

<p>The party at the bank received the cash, tallied it
and handed us gold bars for the same value. These
we took to the Sub-Treasury, where we found Mr.
Ralston smilingly awaiting us with a new cargo of
sacks on the sidewalk. We turned over the bars and
made another journey to the bank.</p>

<p>Thus, at dead of night, passing to and fro, we transferred
in actual weight, between the Sub-Treasury and
the bank nearly five tons of gold. We did not get quite
as much as Ralston wanted, before the light began to
break. It was a heart-breaking job from a physical
standpoint. I was young and athletic and stood my
end of it in good shape. But Maurice Dore was of
sedentary habit, soft as mush, and he was on the verge
of collapse. He was nearly chest foundered and had
a swayback appearance for a month. During all this
time, not a person passed to interrupt us. This was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
doubtless due to a prearrangement with the policeman
on the beat.</p>

<p>When the Bank of California opened the next morning
a rather ominous looking crowd was in waiting.
Lines began to form behind the paying tellers’ windows.
It wasn’t a “run,” but a “near-run.” Ralston appeared
on the scene and looked annoyed, as he said, “Why are
you making so many of our customers wait on a busy
day? Put more tellers on the windows and have your
coin on hand.” More tellers went to the windows.
Porters brought tray after tray from the vaults. It
was amazing how the crowd changed their minds about
wanting their money and melted away. And all over
the troubled city the report spread that the Bank of
California had coin to burn, and the news caused a
general relief.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, a serious run started on one of the leading
banks. Ralston hurried to the spot, mounted a
dry goods box and addressed the crowd. He told them
they were doing the bank and the city a great injustice.
He declared that the bank was absolutely sound&mdash;which
was the truth. He further told the crowd that they need
not wait for a line-up. Just bring their books to the
Bank of California and they would be accommodated
with the cash there. Again, the crowd slunk away
abashed.</p>

<p>Thus a tremendous panic, the consequences of which
might have been world-wide, was averted by a bold
front, a nervy bluff backed by a million in cash. Three
days later, President Grant reversed himself and allowed
gold to be exchanged at the Sub-Treasury for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
cash, which settled all anxiety. This was brought about
through the agency of Jesse Seligman, the New York
banker, who gave the President a banquet and then
showed him his mistake.</p>

<p>But neither Mills nor Sharon, who were leading officers
of the bank, ever knew how Ralston gathered in
nearly a million dollars after banking hours that day.
All the satisfaction they ever got was that a kind friend
had come to the bank’s assistance.</p>

<i>Railroad Madness Results in the Narrator Securing
Franchise for Line From Sausalito to Humboldt.</i></span></h2>

<p>Way back in 1868, the Legislature passed a bill giving
a franchise to a corporation organized under the
name of the San Francisco &amp; Humboldt Bay Railroad
Company, to construct a railroad from an indefinite
point on the bay of San Francisco to Eureka, in Humboldt
county. The franchise was coupled with a provision
that the electors of the counties through which it
passed should be authorized to vote a subsidy in bonds
of $5,000 per mile, payable as every section of 25 miles
was completed. That was about enough to pay for
the rails. The franchise was later extended to the
waterfront of Sausalito, but that was surrendered to the
Sausalito Land and Ferry Company.</p>

<p>The franchise was held by Fred McCrellish of the
Alta; J.&nbsp;F. McCauley, a well known business “rustler”;
General Connor, a temporary sojourner from the Northwest,
and I think H.&nbsp;T. Templeton had a small interest.
None of them had any capital to speak of, and
they had no other design than to peddle the franchise
to someone who had.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span></p>

<p>Of course, the promoters had done nothing in the
way of construction, and the rights were in a fair way
to lapse, when Fred McCrellish drew my attention to
this paper property and asked me to make an offer. The
Central Pacific was then nearing completion. Like most
people in the State, I was railroad mad, and being on
the lookout for everything good, I referred his proposition
to an expert. The report of the engineer was very
favorable and when I found they wanted only $20,000
for all their rights and franchises for a railroad from
Sausalito to Humboldt Bay, I readily closed the bargain
and bought them out, all except one-tenth, which
J.&nbsp;F. McCauley owned.</p>

<p>Then I looked into the proposition seriously. I went
over the ground in person, realized the vast opportunities
presented, particularly in the great forests of the
Eel River country, which were still Government land.
The way things were going then, it would have been
no trick at all to introduce a bill in Congress asking
for a land grant through a country to be traversed by
a railroad, and get half a million acres or more just
for the asking. It seemed to me a bigger game than
all the gold mines, speculations and investments I had
ever seen or dreamed of. I tried to interest Ralston,
but he said I was visionary, and made some remarks
about “back lands” and “coyote ranges.”</p>

<p>That did not deter me in the slightest. I had abundant
capital of my own, and very important financial
connections, and had no doubt that I could complete
the undertaking on my own account. With a good
corps of engineers I began to rush the work of surveys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
and locations with my customary impetuosity. In
a short time I had the dirt flying at Petaluma and
several other points north. I contracted for fifty miles
of ties as a start and bought fifty miles of rail, some
ten miles here and the rest in England. I was perfectly
infatuated with the railroad business and determined
to devote my life and energies to the work.</p>

<p>Needing all the money I could get to handle this
enormous enterprise, I suggested to Ralston that we
hold an auction sale of our joint possessions. We had
laid out New Montgomery street in good style. We
had completed our plans for the Grand Hotel, and the
inquiry for our holding was brisk. Besides, San Francisco
was in the grip of a tremendous real estate craze,
the biggest in its history. The railroad would be with
us in a few months. Then everybody would be rich.</p>

<p>We had incorporated under the name of the Montgomery
Street Land Company. The moment an auction
sale of its properties was announced the whole
town was alert. The offices of the company were
crowded with investors eager to purchase at private
sale, but were told that we were going to have an old-fashioned
auction and nothing else.</p>

<p>It was less than a week before this historic event
took place when the minimum prices were arranged.
Ralston, Maurice Dore and myself met in a back office
of the Bank of California one night and discussed this
all-important question. Finally we agreed that each
should write on a slip of paper his opinion of an average
price per front foot. I based my figures on a profit
of two and a half millions, which seemed to me a fair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
return. But when we came to compare the slips,
Ralston’s figures were just double mine, while Dore’s
were intermediate&mdash;nearer mine.</p>

<p>Ralston’s nature was sanguine. He never saw anything
but success. He had supreme confidence in his
judgment, not without foundation, and possessed a
knack of bringing everyone to his own views. If he was
right in this instance, of course five million dollars were
more desirable than two and a half. I yielded to his
arguments, but not without grave misgivings.</p>

<p>That auction sale was memorable for many a year.
By consent, it was held on the floor of the Merchants’
Exchange, and there never was such a throng
of moneyed men gathered together in San Francisco.
Everyone seemed keyed up to buy a lot or have a free
fight. Maurice Dore and his spieler, Cobb, were past
masters in all the auctioneer’s arts to promote enthusiasm.
Among his “cappers,” to bid the prices up,
were Mills, Hayward, Sharon, Tom Selby and William
Alvord. Pandemonium broke loose when the first offering
was announced. Men fought and raved, like
brokers filling “shorts” on a stock exchange. The same
scenes were re-enacted time after time, but it became
only too evident to insiders that our “cappers” were
picking up everything ostensibly sold. The fact was
that the public would have gone above my estimate,
might have touched Dore’s, but stopped short of Ralston’s.
After keeping up the hippodrome long enough
to save our faces, the great sale was adjourned without
a day.</p>

<p>But that wasn’t the worst of it. For months we had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
been living in a fool’s paradise over the boom that
would follow the driving of the last spike. That day
came, but what a disappointment! It may have seemed
all right to the proletariat, but for the business people
it spelled ruin. It brought in an avalanche of goods
from Chicago and St. Louis, at prices which our local
men could not meet. Many firms failed, some consolidated,
some retired from business. Rents dropped
like lead, real estate values shriveled up to nothing. It
was ten years before those values recovered to the level
of 1869.</p>

<p>Meanwhile my railroad in Sonoma was being rushed
ahead. I do not think it would have encountered opposition
had I stuck to my original plans of a coast line
through Marin, Sonoma, Mendocino and Humboldt.
But my vision began to broaden. I knew of Beckwith
Pass and the almost increditable fatuity that overlooked
it in constructing the Central Pacific Railroad. I employed
General W.&nbsp;S. Rosecrans and a corps of engineers
and began a railroad survey westward from the
pass, to connect with the Humboldt system. I guess
this gave the Big Four the largest scare they received
in many years.</p>

<p>Instantly I found my enterprise blockaded with all
kinds of petty obstructions. I had thirty miles of road
graded and the ties strung. Peter Donahue had partly
agreed to sell me the rails. Suddenly he withheld them
from the market, and there were no more on the Pacific
Coast. I had twenty miles of rail on the water
from England. The vessel was detained at Valparaiso<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
and at last sunk peacefully in the harbor. My agent,
A.&nbsp;A. Cohen, always claimed the ship was scuttled.</p>

<p>I ordered another large shipment from England. Then
the railroad people tried another tack. They appealed
to Ralston to subdue me. Ralston had been the friend
of the Big Four in the trying construction days. They
had promised him all sorts of things in return, among
others a concession to build all their cars, for which
he made great preparations. They plainly told him
that if he did not constrain me, his estimable partner,
to abandon my railroad projects, the concession would
be canceled and he could expect nothing but war.</p>

<p>Ralston laid the matter before me as a friend. He
admitted that he had no right to influence my action,
but said he was facing an enormous loss; that I
could sell out at a large profit, and frankly asked me
to strain a point. The matter once placed in that light,
I yielded, with great reluctance. After some negotiations,
I sold my railroad rights to Peter Donahue.
These rights, only partially developed, constituted the
bulk of his great fortune.</p>

<p>That incident made a vast difference, not alone in
my fortunes, but in the history of California.</p>

<p>Left to myself, I would have had a railroad to Humboldt
bay thirty-five years ago, and would now be the
owner of the Northwestern Pacific Railroad.</p>

<p>Also it is more than probable that my youthful energies
would have carried another railroad eastward
through Beckwith Pass. That would have made history,
changed our Governors, United States Senators,
bosses and the whole machinery of state.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span></p>

<p>As for poor Ralston, he was gold-bricked. He never
received the car concession at all. I cannot tell why,
for I was out of the State when that scheme went up
in smoke. The great building he had constructed for
the purpose was converted into the West Coast Furniture
Company’s plant, which was operated during
his lifetime at a heavy loss.</p>

<p>I can only think of Ralston as a long cherished and
lamented friend. But so far as business went, our acquaintance
began and ended under an unlucky star.</p>

<i>Promoters Appeal to Legislature and Do Not Neglect
Precaution of First “Seeing” Vote Brokers.</i></span></h2>

<p>When Ralston and I opened New Montgomery street
we never doubted that its manifest importance would
compel an immediate and voluntary extension to the
natural terminus of the waterfront and prove the logical
outlet for congested trade. That this would have
been the case had the majority of property owners
been able to follow our example, I have no reasonable
doubt. But just as in the case of “Montgomery Street
Straight,” special interests and selfish considerations
stood in the way. Less than half a dozen property owners,
to their irreparable disadvantage, blocked “Montgomery
Straight”&mdash;a project that would have changed
the whole course of the city’s progress and development.
Just two property owners prevented the immediate
extension of New Montgomery street to the bay,
and again the failure was the city’s heavy loss.</p>

<p>These two men were Milton S. Latham and John Parrott.
Latham owned a stately home and large grounds
on Folsom street, directly in the line of the new thoroughfare.
It was a matter of no small personal pride,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
and doubtless he was attached to the locality. He asked
such a fabulous price for the right-of-way, which of
course would have destroyed the home value of the
property, that even Ralston and myself, who were accustomed
to brush any minor obstacles out of our way
without counting costs, stood aghast.</p>

<p>John Parrott, on the other hand, wouldn’t trade at
all. His business hours were then strictly limited from
9 to half-past 10, and every time we managed to secure
an interview, all the satisfaction we could get out of
him was a promise to fight us every inch of the way.</p>

<p>Outside of these two, we had a clear field. We secured
contracts on a great number of properties along
the line of the proposed thoroughfare. All the large
owners concerned favored it with enthusiasm. Still we
were absolutely blocked.</p>

<p>Under these conditions, nothing remained but an appeal
to the Legislature to appoint a commission, empowered
to open New Montgomery street for its full
length and assess benefits and damages as provided by
the general laws then in force.</p>

<p>And while about it, we did not stop there. We
worked out a grand, comprehensive scheme of improvement,
embracing the immense territory to the south.</p>

<p>Two years before, a bill had been lobbied through the
Legislature providing for what became famous later on
as the “Second Street Cut.” It was a rascally project,
a sordid bit of real estate roguery, carried through
without a moment’s thought of other people’s rights.
But it was an accomplished feat, and one of the results
was to ruin the finest haunt of good breeding San<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
Francisco ever had. Families were scattering from Rincon
Hill to various sections of the city. The old high-priced
residence property was going for a song. As
the “Hill” had ceased to be either beautiful or useful,
Ralston and I calmly proposed to cut it down.</p>

<p>We planned to have the city buy the property, which
could be purchased for $5,000,000 according to arrangement
with the owners, and grade it to the Market-street
level. Many million cubic yards of excavated material
were used to fill in a 150-acre tract of tide land,
offered to the city by the State at a nominal price, lying
between the Pacific Mail docks and Islais Creek; also
to reclaim China Basin, at least in part. The cost of
grading and reclamation work was estimated at $7,000,000;
in fact, contractors were willing to undertake it at
that price. In other words, the city was asked to issue
its bonds for $12,000,000 and receive in payment over
200 blocks of choice property, to say nothing of great
advantage to the appearance of the town and the facilities
for doing business.</p>

<p>Two separate bills were introduced in the Legislature.
One provided for the opening of New Montgomery
street to the bay, and created a commission to carry
out its purpose as above defined. This would probably
have slipped through without any serious opposition;
but coupled with it, in a way, was the great constructive
bill for acquiring Rincon Hill, for filling the tideland
acreage and China Basin and running all the streets
from First to Third, including an extension of Sansome
street, on a nearly level grade, southward to the
waterfront. For the extension of Sansome street Michael<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
Reese, Lloyd Tevis and myself had bought a solid block
from Market to Folsom street.</p>

<p>Taken during his active career
in San Francisco</p></div></div>

<p>I was very much a novice in politics, but Mr. Ralston
insisted that I should have full charge of the program
and take up my residence in Sacramento pending the
session of the Legislature. So among other things I
gathered quite an exact idea of how wires used to
be manipulated underground.</p>

<p>In the first place, the necessity of a Legislature was
not apparent at that time. What had been an able and
independent body in the early history of California had
degenerated to a mere recording machine for a couple
of vote brokers, “Nap” Broughton and “Zeke” Wilson
by name. “Nap,” brief for Napoleon, was a happy,
enthusiastic chap, always slapping someone on the back
with a heartiness not always quite sincere; a good fellow
in his way, and a most abandoned corrupter of
men, a spendthrift disciple of nearly every sin, with
an ever-watchful eye on the money of others, yet himself
the veriest sucker that ever lived.</p>

<p>“Zeke” Wilson, on the other hand, was a gray, desiccated,
sinister, old spider, who seldom smiled, and when
he did everyone in his presence felt depressed. He was
the “thinking member” of the duumvirate, and while
“Nap” Broughton made nearly all the noise “Zeke”
Wilson laid the plans.</p>

<p>The Senate used to be respectable in appearance, an
able body and reasonably clean. The one that I was
concerned with contained such men as Hager and Saunders
of San Francisco, George C. Perkins of Butte, who
made then his first appearance in politics; Rumaldo Pacheco,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
afterward Governor; Pendergast of Napa, Lewis
of Tehama, and several others whose names are fairly
connected with the history of the State.</p>

<p>The Assembly, on the other hand, was a conglomeration
of miscellaneous riff-raff, gathered together God
knows how, inexperienced, ignorant, venal and scandalously
cheap. Of course there were some honorable
exceptions. I am only speaking of the general rule. It
was in the Assembly, not the Senate, that the “business”
of the session was done. That is, if Messrs.
Broughton and Wilson wanted to kill a measure, they
never worried what the Senate did, but let the obnoxious
bill come before the “popular-priced” Assembly,
where its shrift was short.</p>

<p>No one in his senses ever came to Sacramento with
a bill involving a considerable question of finance without
establishing friendly relations with Messrs. Broughton
and Wilson at the start. Treaties of alliance were
negotiated through Napoleon Broughton. At our first
interview $35,000 passed hands. “Nap” merely said
in a casual way that I was a gentleman and I accepted
the compliment for what it was worth. What became
of that money I have no means of knowing, and never
inquired. That would have been the height of bad manners.
But he never asked me for any more, and everything
I wanted slid through the Assembly on greased
ways.</p>

<p>We were among the first who made a consistent effort
to impress the merits of our measures on law-makers
by systematic good-fellowship. I practically
chartered a well known restaurant, threw it open to my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
friends, and the bills were over $400 a day, so generously
did they respond to my invitation. Down in
San Francisco, Ralston was on the lookout for statesmen,
and none of them struck the town without good
cause to remember the experience pleasantly.</p>

<p>In a way, it was a striking session&mdash;a sort of breaking
of new ground. The railroad appeared for the
first time as a seeker for favors. It had two leading
bills, each providing for a subsidy for railroads southward,
one through the San Joaquin Valley and one
along the coast line. Neither terminated anywhere in
particular; the former somewhere in Kern county, the
latter in San Luis Obispo county, near the border line
of Santa Barbara. The measures simply authorized the
electors of the counties concerned to vote for a subsidy
payable to the first railroad that came along. The combined
subsidies provided for amounted to only $3,000,000,
but they were regarded as the opening wedges
for more. Of course everyone knew what that first
railroad would be. Strangely enough, in the newspaper
and legislative discussions, no one seemed to think that
Los Angeles cut any figure as a terminal or feeder.
The cry was for a railroad south to the Colorado river.
For that the people were willing to pay any kind of
subsidy, but not a cent for a couple of local concerns.
A bitter newspaper war followed, and charges of corruption
were freely made. But the bills passed both
houses by large majorities, and were only halted in their
triumphant progress by the veto of Governor Haight.
Even then, it was a close call. The Assembly enthusiastically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
passed one of them over his veto, and in the
Senate the same action failed by only two votes.</p>

<p>There were so many bills of a shady, not to say rotten,
nature introduced during the session that almost
all measures were looked on as “jobs.” Our two bills&mdash;“Montgomery
South” and the effacement of Rincon
Hill&mdash;took their places with the rest. They were harshly
criticized by most of the San Francisco papers as crafty
schemes, the true inwardness of which would develop
later on. They were likened to the “Second Street
Cut” outrage, and a lot of ill-advised public opinion
was worked up against both. Nevertheless, they passed
the Legislature. How one of them became a law is an
interesting story, told in many official records of the
State.</p>

<p>The bill for the extension of New Montgomery street
had gone to Governor Haight. It leaked out from the
executive chambers that a veto message was being prepared.
The Governor had ten days in which to veto
the bill, otherwise it became a law by default. It was
on the afternoon of the last day, shortly after the
Senate had re-assembled, when one of my attorneys,
Creed Haymond, said in a musing way, “If the Senate
could only be induced to adjourn we would not have
to worry about a veto message. Then it could not be
delivered to anyone, and by twelve o’clock to-night
would become a law.” That set me thinking in a
moment. “Is that correct?” I asked. Haymond replied
that he was certain, although he was not sure
that the point had ever been tested by the courts.</p>

<p>The emergency demanded swift work. To offer a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
motion to adjourn, just after settling down to business,
would certainly have aroused suspicion and a general
rumpus. Here I worked in a bit of strategy or
what might have more properly been called chicane,
which I trust may be pardoned me in my final account.</p>

<p>Senator John S. Hager was the leader of what might
be called the “reformers” and had quite a following
among his fellow members. He was the unwearied foe
of anything like a job. Among other measures, he had
opposed the Montgomery Street Extension bill. But
there were several bills on a special file that afternoon
that were his pet abominations and he justly feared
that they might slip through. While in this frame of
mind, a certain gentleman called him aside and advised
him that several members were anxious for an
adjournment, that if he would make the motion it
would probably carry and the obnoxious bills would
lose their places on the special file and their chance of
final passage.</p>

<p>The Senator swallowed the bait&mdash;hook, sinker and all.
While he was lining up the “reformers,” somebody
else was attending to the “performers,” and when the
gentleman made his motion to adjourn he must have
been gratified at the unexpected support. It went
through <i>nem con</i>, as the lawyers say. The officers of
the Senate were hurried out of the room on one pretext
or another and in a few minutes the chamber was
vacant.</p>

<p>Dr. Edward R. Taylor, later Mayor of San Francisco,
was the very efficient private secretary of Governor
Haight. I was in an agony of fear lest he should pop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
into the Chamber with the fatal message before the
adjournment could be arranged. For this reason, I had
several effective conversationalists stationed between the
Governor’s office and the Senate, to engage the secretary
for a few minutes if he chanced to appear. This
they actually did, although Dr. Taylor has forgotten
the incident. What he does remember was that he
found much to his surprise an empty Senate Chamber,
and after ruminating over the situation for a time,
carried back the veto message to the Governor’s office
and laid it on his desk.</p>

<p>On the following day the Governor attempted to deliver
his message, but the Senate held he was too late.
His Excellency refused to certify the bill to the Secretary
of State as passed and I brought a mandamus suit
to compel him to take that action. The title of the case
was <i>Harpending</i> vs. <i>Haight</i>, and attracted a wide attention
at the time. It was carried to the Supreme Court
on an agreed statement and decided within fifteen days
in my favor. The decision can be found in Vol. 39,
Cal. Reports, page 189. Other Governors have been
cautious not to hold back their vetoes till the last day.
Hager roared like a wounded bull buffalo when he
found out how he had been used, but his lamentation
bore no fruit.</p>

<p>Thus the Montgomery South bill became a law of the
State, although the Governor liked it not. Commissioners
were appointed by Judge Lake, a lot of work
was done in surveys, estimates of benefits and damages,
but in the end it came to naught. Two years later,
while I was in Europe, a bill with a misleading title,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
designed to repeal the act, was introduced and Ralston,
busy with many things, never knew about it until it had
sneaked through both houses and become a law. Because
of this, New Montgomery street still halts at
Howard street and bids fair to camp there forever more.</p>

<p>As to the Rincon Hill measure, that also passed both
houses triumphantly, but was held back through the opposition
of Senator Hager, so that it went to the
Executive just one day beyond the period when a return
to the Legislature must be made. It found a
peaceful resting place in the Governor’s capacious
pocket.</p>

<p>Thus all our grand schemes for the development of
the city southward fell by the dreary wayside of lost
opportunity. I do not pretend for a moment that Ralston
and myself were inspired in our efforts by the
pure spirit of benevolence. We would have made our
profit, but a mere trifle in comparison to the public good.
It was the most comprehensive plan for the city’s improvement
ever presented in a concrete form, and the
pity is it was not better understood.</p>

<p>Just take a retrospect. Who is there who would not
admit that five fine level streets from Market, between
First and Third, southward to the bay, would not be a
vast improvement and convenience to business, over the
blockade that prevails to-day?</p>

<p>And was such a real estate proposition ever before
offered to a people and turned down? For the sum of
$12,000,000 the city would have acquired full title to
approximately two hundred and twenty blocks, the present
value of which would be hard to estimate exactly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
But a rough valuation indicates that the property would
be worth enough to pay the entire city debt, buy the
Spring Valley Water Company’s plant, bring in the
Hetch-Hetchy water supply and leave a balance large
enough perhaps to settle all questions with the United
Railroads and municipalize the entire street transportation
system, not in the dim future, but now.</p>

<p>Immense revenues would have flowed into the municipal
treasury from these utilities. Taxation would have
become a joke. All these things are among the haggard,
melancholy “might have beens.”</p>

<p>There were too many well-intentioned, but bigoted,
reformers in the city then, just as there are now.</p>

<p>And the incident serves to indicate the superiority of
hindsight over foresight, which has been illustrated unhappily
and too often in the history of the State.</p>

But Oversight of Owner Costs Him Dearly.</span><br /><br />

by Taking Joe Clark on a Trip to Europe.</i></span></h2>

<p>I was busy with other things besides real estate investments,
financing railroads, and politics, during the
five years between 1865 and 1870. In 1869 I built the
first fine business block on the south side of Market
street, the Harpending Block, between First and Second
streets. It was also in 1869&ndash;1870 that Ralston and myself
built the Grand Hotel, partly on our own land,
partly on land belonging to the Platt estate, which we
held under 20 years’ lease.</p>

<p>The Harpending Block cost nearly $400,000. It was
burned two years later, contributing the biggest fire
in San Francisco since the ’50’s. Through an oversight
of my agent, the insurance hardly represented a tenth
of the loss. The Grand Hotel remained for several
years the last word in the hotel business of the Pacific
Coast. It was its phenomenal success from the outset
that induced Ralston later to embark in the Palace Hotel
project, which contributed in a large measure to his
ruin. I owned a three-fourths interest in the Grand
Hotel; Ralston owned the balance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span></p>

<p>No one who has ever had much to do with mining
can keep out of that fascinating business very long.
When I returned to San Francisco from Havilah, it was
my solemn intention to abandon mining forever thereafter
and confine my efforts to what was known as
“legitimate business,” whatever that may be; I have
never found out. But I hadn’t more than barely got my
bearings before I began to make casual incursions in a
sly way into the old field of endeavor, and thus had a
personal and financial acquaintance with, I think, all of
the heroic figures who created the vast deep-mining industry
of the far West.</p>

<p>Only one of these big men has lasted down to our
own time. J.&nbsp;B. Haggin<a name="FNanchor_A" id="FNanchor_A" href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">A</a> still lives at his home in Lexington,
Ky., at a great age&mdash;90 or more&mdash;and until
recently in the enjoyment of good health. A story used
to be current in San Francisco that in the early pioneer
days Haggin was a devotee of play at the El Dorado
and Union. One night, so the narrative runs, after
successive losses he borrowed $100, to win or take the
gambler’s last alternative. But he had no occasion for
the latter. He stood calm and imperturbable as the
hundred became a thousand, and then tens of thousands,
while a circle of mute, white-faced gamblers stood fascinated
at his luck, until the proprietor, in a voice that
showed no tremor, quietly announced the bank closed
for the night. The story goes on to say that Mr. Haggin
never touched a card from that day forth. All of
this I have only on hearsay. Mr. Haggin lives to tell
whether it is true or false.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p>But if he abandoned gambling in one direction, he
took it up in another. In the mining industry he was a
plunger, par excellence. I do not mean that he invested
recklessly or without mature investigation, but when
he once made up his mind, a few millions, more or less,
never moved him from his purpose. The broad, liberal
way he played the game had more to do with the development
of the West than perhaps anything else.</p>

<p>Haggin had nothing in common with good fellowship.
He was always silent, sober and cold. But under
it all he must have had a heart. He was the only one
I ever knew who remembered the men who helped to
give him wealth. Every man, without exception, who
rendered Haggin faithful, efficient service, he made rich.
And he was very loyal to his friends. In these days&mdash;and
other days&mdash;when men of power exhaust the energies
of their subordinates and then toss them without concern
on the scrap pile, like so many sucked-out oranges, and
treat their business associates just a shade better, an
example such as Haggin gave ought not to be overlooked.</p>

<p>George Hearst was probably the greatest natural
miner who ever had a chance to bring his talents into
play on a large scale. He was not a geologist, had
no special education to start with, was not overburdened
with book learning, but he had a congenital instinct
for mining, just as some other people have for
mathematics, music or chess. He was not a man of
showy parts, liked the company of a lot of cronies, to
whom he was kind and serviceable&mdash;when he wasn’t
broke himself&mdash;was much inclined to take the world
easy, but if anyone mentioned mines in his presence, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
had the same effect as saying, “Rats!” to a terrier.
Hearst became alert and on dress parade in a moment.</p>

<p>Hearst made his first big stake on the Comstock
Lode, a year after it was uncovered in 1858. He was
associated with his cousin, Joe Clark, and William M.
Lent. I do not know the exact size of the clean-up,
but it must have reached into seven figures. Such an
event, in the old days was always made memorable by
some kind of a “jamboree.”</p>

<p>Now, Joe Clark was a southwestern man, hailing from
a section not far from where I originated myself. All
of us were inclined to be provincial. For instance, Joe
Clark believed that St. Louis was not only the most
magnificent but the largest city in the world. He had
many heated discussions on the subject and several times
backed his opinions with coin. He declared that the
Rue de Rivoli was a pale shadow alongside of the
glories of Laclede avenue. He swore that St. Louis
was bigger than London, more cultured than Athens
during the age of Pericles and grander and more picturesque
than Babylon, when the hanging gardens were
in full bloom.</p>

<p>It is said that Hearst suggested a “blow out” in
Europe after their clean-up, in order to disabuse his
kinsman’s mind of certain illusions respecting St. Louis.
At any rate, the two husky young miners set their faces
eastward to look over the effete monarchies of the
Old World.</p>

<div id="ip_164" class="figcenter" style="width: 274px;">

  <div class="caption"><p>GEORGE HEARST</p>

<p>An unsurpassed mining genius,<br />
former U.&nbsp;S. Senator</p></div></div>

<p>While they were pleasure bound, “Bill” Lent stayed
behind to look after the investments. He sunk a shaft
which headed dead on for the big bonanza and had he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
continued the work a little further, Flood, O’Brien,
Mackay and Fair would have cut a very small figure in
history. But he engaged unfortunately in a seductive
looking speculation and went to pieces in a grand pyrotechnic
and spectacular failure. Hearst and Clark were
hopelessly involved. They received the news while they
were making the tour of Europe with much eclat. Fortunately
they had money enough to reach home. But
the main object of the journey was accomplished. When
Joe Clark mentioned St. Louis thereafter, it was the
voice of a chastened soul that spoke.</p>

<p>Of course, nothing could keep Hearst down in a
mining region. Any capitalist was only too eager to
back a man with such surpassing talents; but he had
to pay an awful toll. For years Hearst’s projects were
financed at 2½ per cent. per month compounded monthly,
and any business that can stand that strain and come
out ahead must have a solid foundation to build on. He
was the real founder not only of his own but of the vast
Haggin and Tevis fortunes.</p>

<p>I had mining deals of more or less importance with
Haggin, Hearst, Hayward, Hobart, Grayson, in fact,
with nearly all the large operators of those times. My
largest speculations, however, were with Ralston as a
silent partner, which, on average, showed more profit
than loss. It was for the purpose of joint investment
that late in the fall of 1870 I visited the Emma mine
near Salt Lake City, which a year later was the central
point of a great international scandal and will play an
important part in this narrative.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Sam Brannan Strikes It Rich and Refuses to
Share With Mormon Church Except on Order
From Lord.</span><br /><br />

<i>Mine Bargain Fails to Stand Inquiry of Author, But
Others Invest and Figure as Victims of Fraud.</i></span></h2>

<p>I had early been familiar with Utah and its mines,
through an acquaintance with “Sam” Brannan. Brannan
had a history of thrills and adventures which if
gathered into book form would make the heroes of
Dumas look cheap and commonplace. Originally a
Mormon, high in the councils of Brigham Young, he
led a body of his co-religionists around Cape Horn
to California, before the earliest Argonauts. He staked
out claims on the American River, about two miles
from where Folsom prison stands, the location being
known as “Mormon Island” to this day. The diggings
were so rich that one of California’s evanescent
cities sprang up around it, almost overnight, just as
suddenly to disappear. “Sam” worked his companions
on a per diem basis and very soon accumulated a
large fortune&mdash;certainly in excess of a million dollars,
many well informed people estimating it at two or three
times as much. But while he settled promptly his
labor bills, he was not so businesslike in squaring accounts
with the Mormon Church, which claimed nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
all the profits. Finally, a trusted agent was dispatched
from Salt Lake City with a peremptory order on Brannan
to turn over the ecclesiastical share of the “dust”
at once.</p>

<p>Brannan’s reply was historic and to the point, even
if a bit profane. The gold, he said, had been placed in
his safe keeping on the Lord’s account. He would surrender
it upon the Lord’s proper written order; otherwise
not.</p>

<p>“Sam” invested most of his wealth in San Francisco
real estate. An important street bears his name. Like
most of the early Mormon leaders, he was of a coarse-fibered
nature, with a rather forbidding, saturnine face,
but singularly keen-witted, resolute, and fearing neither
man nor devil.</p>

<p>The latter quality stood him in good stead. Brigham
could not permit such a flagrant breach of church discipline
to remain unpunished. Flock after flock of “destroying
angels” took flight from Salt Lake City, duly
commissioned to bring back Samuel’s scalp or perish in
the attempt. But their holy work was always a dismal
failure. Brannan must have had some foreknowledge of
their movement against the security of his person.
Liking not to meet “angels” unawares of any kind, he
arranged to encounter the “destroyers” half way out in
the trackless desert, or mountain fastnesses, with a
competent group of exterminators he seemed to keep
on hand for such occasions; and it was the “angels”
who were always taken unawares. Some of them got
back to Salt Lake minus tail feathers and otherwise
damaged, but the majority of them never returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
at all. At last, the disciplining of Brannan became so
manifestly an extra-hazardous risk that it was finally
abandoned. How he defied the whole power of Mormonism
and actually conducted a private and successful
war against the church was one of the old romances
of the Pacific Coast. In later years Brannan fell a
victim to drink, all his enormous wealth became dissipated
and he died penniless and forgotten in Mexico.</p>

<p>“Sam” never forgot Salt Lake City or Utah. His
life would not have been worth 10 cents if he had once
stepped within the territory of Brigham Young. But
he always cast longing eyes at the scene of his early
struggle. He knew Utah and its resources from end
to end, and in our frequent interviews often mentioned
the illusive, “pockety” nature of its mines. Therefore,
when Ralston and I took a 30-day option on the Emma
mine, about 40 miles from Salt Lake City, I was prepared
to exercise extreme caution in examining the
property.</p>

<p>The Emma mine had startled the Coast with a wonderful
burst of production, considering the limited
nature of its plant. Its wealth was claimed to be fabulous,
and it was a matter of some surprise when its
owner’s offer to sell it at the low price of $350,000 was
made. Nevertheless, the proposition seemed well worth
looking into. But remembering Sam Brannan’s counsel,
I went unannounced to the mine, presented my credentials
to the superintendent, who gave me permission
to examine the property, although rather surprised that
I came alone.</p>

<p>It did not take me long to reach a conclusion that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
Emma mine was nothing more than a large “kidney.”
Considerable high-grade ore had been stoped out of the
upper levels. Below, the ore was plainly pinching out.
The whole thing was nothing but a shell, with just
enough in place to fool a tenderfoot. There was no
trace of a fissure vein. Any mining expert would have
turned it down without a moment’s hesitation.</p>

<p>I had just seen all I cared to see when J.&nbsp;W. Woodman
of Salt Lake City, the principal owner of the property,
hurried to the mine in some agitation and expressed
his regret that I had not advised him of my
coming. However, he trusted everything was satisfactory.
I told him courteously that I could not pass favorably
on the mine, and to consider the option closed.
He wished to argue the matter, but I told him that the
conclusion was final and decisive. Then he took another
tack. He was anxious, he said, to clean up and get
away. If he threw off an even hundred thousand dollars,
would Mr. Ralston and myself take over the property?
Again I answered in the negative, and told him,
in so many words, that we did not want the mine at
any price.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, when it was finally bottomed, the
mine did not yield anything like a hundred thousand
dollars net. I even doubt if it made both ends meet.</p>

<p>Such was the Emma mine, famous, or rather infamous,
in history. Just a little later this barren hole in
the ground figured in one of the biggest swindles of
modern times, in which great names were involved, a
minister of the United States to England disgraced and
ruined, British investors robbed out of ten million dollars,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
and the business world filled with such suspicion
that for many years the doors of foreign credit were
barred against American mining enterprise of every
sort. The very character of Americans for common
honesty was so seriously besmirched that it caused an
international unfriendliness that time only partially
cured.</p>

<p>It was a fact of common knowledge that the mine
had been bonded to Mr. Ralston and myself for $350,000.
It was also well known that I had examined and
must have found it unsatisfactory, for the bond was
allowed to lapse. This alone gave the Emma such a black
eye on the Pacific Coast, then the great market for legitimate
properties, that it became almost a waste of time
to make any further attempt to market it in the neighborhood
where the circumstances were known. Ralston
was rather noted for taking a long chance on mining
ventures, and while his luck lasted he usually pulled
them through. Therefore, when he and his associates
turned down a developed and going concern, the wise,
conservative natures shook their heads. That is doubtless
why the Emma was taken to a market some five
thousand miles from home for exploitation.</p>

<p>In fact, it was practically taken off the market for
quite a while. After it was first offered for sale to
Ralston and myself, my impression is that I was the
only one who examined it qualified to pass an honest
judgment on such a property, until it suddenly blossomed
on the London stock market as the great American
ophir, the newly discovered treasure store, of
which the human imagination had dreamed for ages&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>and
was unloaded on the British public for $10,000,000;
or, to use the parlance of our Anglo-Saxon cousins, for
£2,000,000.</p>

<p>I have gone into the early history of the Emma mine
so minutely because it strikes this narrative a little later
at an angle so acute that the two seem to run parallel,
and it is necessary to have all the facts in hand to
understand how the great swindle that strained the
commercial friendship of two great peoples almost to
the breaking point had a close relation to the diamond
hoax story.</p>

Frightens Off Public at Critical Moment.</i></span></h2>

<p>When I reached Salt Lake City after examining the
Emma mine, I found awaiting me a telegram from
Mr. Ralston to the effect that the president of the Bank
of England, a Mr. Green, then traveling in the Far
West, would be in Cheyenne on a certain day. He
asked me to meet the gentleman, and in his name, as
president of the Bank of California, extend to the visiting
banker any courtesies that his time and inclination
might permit. So I journeyed to Cheyenne in quest of
Mr. Green.</p>

<p>I stopped at the principal hotel and one of the first
persons my eyes rested on was about the most impressive
looking man I ever saw. He must have been six
feet six in his stocking feet; he was richly caparisoned,
handsome, debonair, evidently a Briton and looked like
the president of the Bank of England and the Prince of
Wales rolled into one. I took a chance, approached the
stranger and asked him if he were Mr. Green, president
of the Bank of England. The gentleman laughed and
said I had made a close guess, but had missed the mark
a trifle. He introduced himself as Mr. Morgan, an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
Englishman of leisure, making a sight-seeing tour of
the Far West. Later I discovered that Mr. Green had
passed on without stopping and was then well along on
his journey east.</p>

<p>One of my objects, besides inspecting the Emma mine,
was to examine a property I had acquired in New
Mexico near the headwaters of the Gila river. I had
made an investment on the strength of huge outcroppings
of mineralized ledges that gave indications of a
great mining property. But besides that there was a
large valley, covered waist deep with grass, interspersed
with black walnuts into which luxuriant wild hops
twined, and traversed by a fine stream of water. In
addition to the mining claims, I had secured the water
rights and taken the preliminary steps to acquire a vast
acreage of fertile land. Development work had been
going on for some time and I was anxious to see for
myself just how the property was showing up. I had
several chats with Mr. Morgan after our first odd
meeting, and learning of my projected trip to New
Mexico he asked and readily received my consent to go
along.</p>

<p>Arrived at our destination, Mr. Morgan at once became
infatuated with the country&mdash;ledges, land, water
and all. Some of the prospect work showed ore of high
values. The Englishman took many samples and had
them tested by my assayer. My impression is that, like
every beginner in the mining business, he always chose
the best. Finally, he made me a business proposition.
He said he had important financial connections in England,
that a great diversified property like this could be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
floated for an immense sum&mdash;named $3,000,000 as a fair
estimate, and offered to form a company on an equitable
basis to finance and develop its resources.</p>

<p>With a cooler head, I advised Mr. Morgan that the
mines were still only in the “prospect” state; that they
might turn out something great, but more likely nothing
at all. Concerning the land and water, there was no
question. Properly handled and developed their value
must be great.</p>

<p>After some negotiations, we hit upon a bargain.
Morgan was to go to England post haste. I was to
follow by more leisurely stages, a month later, and
by the time of my arrival everything was to be arranged.</p>

<p>I stopped a few days in New York to see the sights.
While there I met another Englishman by the name of
Dalton, a member of Parliament. I told the gentleman
something of my contemplated trip to England. When
I mentioned the name of Morgan, he seemed a bit
amused. He said Morgan was all right; that he had
excellent family connections, but that he hardly figured
as a financier. He said that his imagination was of an
oriental type, prone to exaggeration and very apt to
make a mess of any large transaction. “If Mr. Morgan
fails,” he added, “you had better come to me.”</p>

<p>When I arrived in England, I found that Mr. Dalton’s
prediction had already come true. Morgan had issued
a prospectus that put the tales of Baron Munchausen
in the shade. He actually described the mines as mountains
of silver, and by his very extravagance of statement
doomed the enterprise from the start. Meanwhile,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
I had various meetings with Mr. Dalton, who
was a man of standing in the business world and
through him met a great firm of brokers, Coates and
Hanky. Mr. Coates was the son of a manufacturer who
won fortune and immortality by his exploits in spool
cotton. These gentlemen agreed to place my proposition
before the investing public. Morgan floundered
around for a short time but was soon discouraged. I
offered him an interest in the new exploitation, with the
understanding that he keep mute.</p>

<p>Coates and Hanky now undertook the enterprise in a
business fashion. The New Mexico Land and Silver
Mining Company was formed, with a high-class directorate.
One of the directors, I recollect, was a retired
admiral of the British navy. The prospectus was flattering
enough, but would stand investigation. Among
other things, it dwelt more on the unquestioned value
of the land and water than the probabilities and possibilities
of the mines. The capitalization was six hundred
thousand pounds.</p>

<p>The London Times was then, as now, the great
newspaper authority of England. Its financial editor,
whose suggestive name was Samson, was currently said
to have more power than the Queen. Five lines favorable
from Samson’s pen in the financial columns of the
Times assured the success of an enterprise. Five lines
unfavorable were equivalent to a death warrant. It
was customary with promoters to submit their plans
to Mr. Samson before submitting them to the public.
The directors of the New Mexico Land and Silver
Mining Company followed this custom and received a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
somewhat cryptic answer which, however, they construed
to be favorable.</p>

<p>The issue was brought out with the skill of trained
hands. Everything pointed to a successful outcome.
But the very next day, Samson came out with a double-barreled
blast. Before the Times reached the country,
a small avalanche of subscriptions poured in. But in
the city, after a large first day’s business, the promotion
fell flat. Nevertheless, the directors stood manfully
by their guns. They received space in the Times to
answer. They put up a bulldog sort of fight. The old
admiral in particular was as belligerent as when he
paced a man-of-war. There was somewhat of a reversal
of public opinion in our favor. More than half
the capital stock was subscribed for and we might
have pulled the issue through, but it seemed to me
that the company was overburdened to start with, that
it must labor under too many handicaps of distrust to
operate successfully, and against the judgment of the
directors I withdrew the properties and the incident was
closed. All the subscribers received their money back,
without cost or abatement. No investor lost a cent.</p>

<p>An incident shortly after my arrival served to illustrate
in a pleasant way my relations with W.&nbsp;C. Ralston
at that time. I was asked to call at the Oriental
Bank, the agency for the Bank of California, and
going there the following day, was ushered into the
presence of the president, an impressive looking man
of affairs. “I have here,” he said, “a cable from W.&nbsp;C.
Ralston, president of the Bank of California, advising
us to give Mr. A. Harpending credit for any sum he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
wants. This is an unlimited order and as you probably
intend to make heavy drafts on us, I thought it advisable
to inquire beforehand how much you were likely to
want.” I laughed and told him I had all the money
I needed, but if I happened to want accommodation I
would certainly call for more. The story is immaterial
in itself, except as an illustration of Ralston’s offhand
way of doing business, and his confidence in me as his
friend.</p>

<p>Another pleasant incident was the renewing of my
acquaintance with Alfred Rubery, who again becomes
a leading figure in this story. He was the same old
Rubery of the “Chapman days.” John Bright, his illustrious
uncle, was at the height of his prestige and
power, and Rubery himself was in the swim with the
biggest kind of social and political fish.</p>

<p>And still another incident was that I came in personal
contact with the famous Baron Grant, the overlord
of financial London.</p>

<i>Happy Directors Decide That Occasion Calls for Generous
Cash Souvenirs, But Stockholders Object.</i></span></h2>

<p>Those who are familiar with the staid, conservative,
even-paced London of to-day can hardly realize what
that same London was in 1871, the period of my first
visit there. It was the year of the great Franco-Prussian
war. The pleasure capital of the world was transferred
from the River Seine to the River Thames.
Male and female adventurers of every nation thronged
the British capital; speculators eager to tap the great
reservoirs of English wealth, gentlemen who lived by
their wits, chevaliers d’industrie in general, made London
a common trysting place. And the life was to correspond.
It was notable for undisguised and shameless
intemperance, a primitive, savage, heathenish pursuit of
women and a fevered spirit of gambling speculation that
cut loose from all moorings of common sense. I could
compare it only to the recklessness and abandon of a
Western mining camp in the orgy of flush times.</p>

<p>The speculative world was ruled and controlled by a
strange character, for many years one of the famous
figures in London, Baron Grant, the same man I mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
in the last chapter. He was half Hebrew, half
Irish, and it has been my experience that wherever you
find that combination you can look out for something
different from the common run. His real name was
Gottheimer, but he had it changed by act of Parliament
to Alfred Grant. He came by his title in a curious way.
When the nascent kingdom of Italy, years before, had
attempted to raise a considerable sum and had been
turned down in the money marts of Europe, Grant,
then in the height of his prestige, offered his services
and floated triumphantly the discarded securities, for
which service the grateful Italian government honored
him with the title of baron.</p>

<p>When I first met him Baron Grant was past his
zenith. Some of his transactions had been disapproved
by the great financiers, but he was still a potent factor
in the domain of speculation and a promoter without a
peer.</p>

<p>Personally, he had the magnetic temperament more
highly developed than any man I ever knew. His
manners were engaging, he was simply a wonder in
conversation, and as he spoke his handsome face was
lighted with candid smiles that no one could resist.
Whoever came within the sphere of Baron Grant’s
influence felt the intoxication of his power to charm.</p>

<p>Meeting several times under favorable auspices, we
talked of the mines of California and the transmississippi
region in general, concerning which I could speak
with first-hand knowledge. He was deeply interested,
said that such properties would have a ready sale on
the booming London market and promised that if I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
could only secure an option on a high-grade mining
proposition, it would prove a very profitable piece of
business to both of us.</p>

<p>I cabled Mr. Ralston, naming three well known developed
mines and asked him to secure me an option on
one of them. In answer I received a cable from William
M. Lent, president of the Mineral Hill Silver
Mining Company, in which I owned a quarter interest
myself, offering an option on that property for a million
dollars. Within a month all the necessary papers
arrived by mail. These included, besides a legally
drawn option, a full description of the property, its
productive history, maps, engineer’s reports, estimates
of tonnage in sight and all the details that a careful
investor might require. In addition there was a private
agreement, duly executed, giving me a commission of 10
per cent.</p>

<p>It certainly was an alluring proposition. The Mineral
Hill mine was located in eastern Nevada. Traveling on
the Narrow Gauge Railroad, from the Palisades, a station
on the Southern Pacific, to Eureka, you can still
see the ruins of its plant. It was a sulphide ore that
required preliminary roasting and then became tractable
and free. Besides the furnaces, the equipment consisted
of only a 20-stamp mill. Yet the ore was of so high
grade that the gross production had reached the enormous
total of $150,000 in a single month. Much of the ground
was totally unexplored, though promising.</p>

<p>Baron Grant laid out his promotion with his consummate
skill. He possessed a complete knowledge of the
investing public. At that time&mdash;and probably still&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>investors
and speculators, as a rule, confined themselves
to a single line. One dabbled in coal, another in iron
mines, another in silver mines, another in gold mines
and so on down the line. Informed of the specialty of
each, the astute baron knew exactly where to go for
customers, and never wasted time. The plans provided
for an issue of £600,000 of common stock and £300,000
of debenture bonds, the latter to be used for a
plant to quadruple production.</p>

<p>The enterprise was ably advertised and this time
Samson was tractable and kind. Interest was keen, but
I think even Baron Grant was rather surprised at what
followed. When the books were opened there was a
crush to get on board, and when we had a chance to
assemble figures everything had been gobbled up and
the stock twice oversubscribed. Our net profit was
£300,000, or, in American money, $1,500,000.</p>

<p>I had several experiences in the easy-money line, but
this put them all in the shade. I was confident that my
mission in life was to place American mining securities
on the London market. Baron Grant and myself entered
into a written agreement. I was to secure options
on high-class mining properties. I had in mind the
Raymond &amp; Ely, North Bloomfield, Eureka Consolidated
and Zellerbach mines. Grant, on his part, agreed to
handle no other mining properties but mine. With this
understanding, I did not even wait for the Mineral Hill
melon cutting, but set out post-haste for San Francisco
to lay in a new stock of options for the foundation of
wealth beyond the dreams of avarice.</p>

<p>The news of my success in placing the Mineral Hill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
mine in London had made quite a stir in my home town
and I was deluged with offers of mining properties,
good and bad. Quite a jubilee occurred when the first
half million dollars on account of the purchase price for
Mineral Hill was made payable at the Bank of California.
The directors of the company were so enthusiastic
that they voted themselves $5000 each as a “souvenir”
and added a “souvenir” of $25,000 for the president.
The other $500,000 arrived in due season, but the
sordid stockholders, who seemed singularly devoid of
imagination, objected so strongly to “souvenirs” that
this feature of the celebration was overlooked.</p>

<p>I had no difficulty at all in securing options on several
of the most assured mining properties of California and
the Pacific Slope. From these alone I figured to make
millions, judging by the history of Mineral Hill. Figuring
on a prolonged stay abroad, I broke up my residence
in San Francisco, gave Maurice Dore a power of attorney
to manage my local interests, and left with my
family for London, to change paper into gold.</p>

Out Option for Mine That Soon Developed
Bonanza.</span><br /><br />

<i>Exploiter Breaks His Promise and Litigation Follows;
Public Fooled Into Buying Worthless Securities.</i></span></h2>

<p>I returned to London as soon as my business was arranged
in San Francisco. The boom times were still
on. Speculation was running mad. I was a trifle
chagrined at losing the best property I had bonded
through the stubbornness of Baron Grant. This was
the famous Raymond and Ely mine. By the payment of
$10,000 I had secured an option on this famous property
for sixty days for $900,000. I had cabled Grant about
Raymond and Ely, in order to hasten arrangements,
as the time was short. He answered that nothing
short of 90 days’ option should be considered. I tried
to secure an extension, but was turned down. While
we were see-sawing over this and time was slipping by,
the company offered to return my $10,000 and let the
option drop. Under the conditions, I accepted the
tender. Just a week later the Raymond and Ely bonanza
was uncovered, yielding millions in dividends.
After that no one could purchase it at any price.
Whether the owners really knew anything about this
tremendous “strike” when they so generously tendered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
me the return of my $10,000 deposit the reader can
guess as well as I.</p>

<p>But that was a small matter, I had so many shots
in my locker. Among these was the famous North
Bloomfield hydraulic mine. I had an option on it for
$600,000. In my judgment, which afterwards came
true, it was worth at least five times as much. One of
the principal owners, Samuel F. Butterworth, followed
me to England. Talking of Baron Grant and his power
of fascination, I introduced him to Butterworth, who
was an able man, but cold and unemotional as fate, and
after a ten minutes’ talk the Baron had him spellbound.
“There never was a human being like him,” said Butterworth
as we retired.</p>

<p>Baron Grant was measurably glad to see me, but
not so cordial as the circumstances led me to expect.
I spoke to him about the North Bloomfield mine and
my desire to have the proposition laid before the public
without unnecessary delay, but he seemed singularly
backward. At last the cat escaped from the bag. He
had violated his written contract by agreeing to bring
out another mining exploitation, ahead of mine. But
my indignation at his absolute lack of faith was nothing
compared with my astonishment&mdash;almost horror&mdash;when
he told me that the property he proposed to unload on
the British public for a million pounds sterling was
none other than the Emma mine.</p>

<p>I had no desire to continue business relations with a
man who had shown himself so utterly without faith;
but I was at some pains to explain the folly of his
project from a mere practical standpoint, setting common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
honesty to one side. I told Baron Grant that I was
familiar with the Emma mine, that Mr. Ralston and
myself had recently held an option on the property for
$350,000; that I had personally inspected the property
and found it a nearly worked out “kidney”; that the
principal owner had later offered it to me for $250,000;
that I considered it dear at any price. In conclusion, I
urged that to promote such a fraudulent concern for a
huge sum would not only cause a scandal of far-reaching
proportions, but would also ruin the market for
American securities for many years to come.</p>

<p>Baron Grant listened coldly. He said he had every
confidence in the Emma mine and those behind it.
That the proposition had been brought to England by
Trenor W. Park, a New York financier, once of California;
that it was vouched for by such men of prominence
as Senator William M. Stewart of Nevada and
by the American Minister, General Robert Schenck.
He had no fear of a mine guaranteed by such weighty
names. As for my own properties, he said he would
take them up when his convenience suited. Otherwise,
he possessed the power to prevent any other interest
floating them. The interview ended in a violent quarrel.</p>

<p>Even when I demanded my share of the profits in
the Mineral Hill deal, Baron Grant held me off with
specious promises of speedy settlement, then flatly refused
to settle at all. By this time we were sworn
enemies. I brought an action for the recovery of a
hundred and fifty thousand pounds, $750,000 of our
money. The Baron harassed me with the usual legal
impediments, but in the end, I may say here, that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
gained a judgment and what was more important still,
collected the amount sued for in full.</p>

<p>I sought new outlets for my mining properties, among
the highest financial circles of England, not by means
of stock exchange exploitation but by sales to intelligent
and provident investors. The North Bloomfield
mine was well and favorably known in England. One
of its owners was Tom Bell, an English resident of San
Francisco, who cut a large figure in the old days. I had
actually arranged the complete details of the sale of this
property for four hundred thousand pounds. A meeting
was held to confirm the transaction and pay in half
the purchase price, when an unfortunate remark of Mr.
Butterworth caused a halt. He said, doubtless in good
faith, that no English manager was capable of handling
a California hydraulic mine. But this so offended some
of the principal English investors that they quietly
withdrew.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, the Emma mine promotion was
brought out with a grand blare of trumpets. Immense
sums were spent in wholesale advertising. The most
dazzling and seductive literature was scattered broadcast
through the length and breadth of the United Kingdom.
Its fabulous wealth was described in the vivid language
that fires the speculative spirit latent in every man and
in most women. Special stress was laid on the eminent
station of the American backers. I have seen much
lurid get-rich-quick literature of our own, at a time
when the industry of plucking the public was unchecked
and in full bloom, but nothing that took rank with the
effrontery employed to bolster up this brazen fraud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span></p>

<p>Of course, the promotion was a huge success. When
the subscription books were opened a small river of
gold poured in from applicants for shares. The issue
was enormously over-subscribed. Baron Grant and his
associates selected, as far as possible, the smaller class
of investors. These are less able to roar in an effective
manner when the inevitable day of reckoning
comes for every crooked deal.</p>

<p>The Emma mine was regularly listed on the London
stock exchange, alongside of reputable and conservative
companies. It became the feature of a tremendous
gamble. In the hands of expert market manipulators,
the stock ebbed and flowed like the tide. Stories of
fabulous dividends were passed from mouth to mouth
and the stock soared from one high level to another till
ten pound shares touched thirty-two pounds. This absolutely
valueless and exhausted property had a paper
value of $16,000,000. When it shrank under profit
taking and selling pressure, reports of new strikes, vast
ore bodies uncovered, sent the prices booming once
more. Had it not been for the utter heartlessness of
the thing, one could almost admire the skill with which
a huge deception was organized and kept alive.</p>

<p>Of course, I shouted “murder” from the housetops. I
publicly denounced the Emma mine as an exhausted,
worthless hole in the ground. It was like a voice raised
in the wilderness. No one paid the least attention to
my warnings in the midst of the bawling crowd. I was
classified either as a general calamity howler or as the
leader of a “bear” faction, anxious to organize a “bear”
raid and interrupt the wave of prosperity. At length, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
gain a larger audience and put my statements in responsible
form, I made an effort in a new field of endeavor
by founding the London Stock Exchange Review.</p>

<p>Many times I had learned to have a deep respect for
printer’s ink. I had seen it make history, change fortune,
influence the thought of great bodies of people,
prove a mighty instrument for good or ill. Without the
least desire to be disrespectful to the present, I have a
strong impression that the journalism of fifty years
ago had a wider dominion over the minds of its readers
than the modern school. I cannot say that this was
always for the best. Men had a blind devotion to their
pet newspapers that amounted to something very much
akin to bigotry. Such newspapers were the final authority
on everything from religion to politics, and
everyone who questioned their opinions, politics or
statements had a fair prospect for a fight. Thus when
an editor fell into some grievous error he was certain
to pull nearly all of his subscribers into the same abyss.</p>

<p>So I realized that to have any influence in my new
place of business, to attack the power of Baron Grant,
now bitterly antagonistic in every way, and to offset
the Emma mine fraud, I must have a personal organ.
For this purpose, I established a financial weekly paper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
known as the London Stock Exchange Review. It was
issued, for apparent reasons, ostensibly by a brokerage
firm, but it was an open secret that the publication was
mine. I engaged an able editor-in-chief, and directed
him to employ the best financial writers in England,
giving each his proper department, such as railroad
securities, industrial, mining shares, foreign and domestic
loans and the like. I retained a page for which I
furnished material hot enough to burn holes in an
asbestos blanket. The page was devoted to the Emma
mine and Baron Grant.</p>

<p>The Stock Exchange Review was a breezy, well-written
sheet, full of valuable information to investors,
put together in an attractive, readable form. I had
set aside £6,000 to pay the losses of the venture.
Much to my surprise and pleasure, it proved a money-maker
from the start. The style was such a departure
from the ordinary dry-as-dust publications of its kind
that it made a hit on the street with the first issue.
The price was a shilling, but often big premiums were
offered when it came out with an extra seasoning of
tabasco.</p>

<p>I had reason to know that it tickled the hide of
Baron Grant unpleasantly. It managed to hit on a
number of raw spots in his past career, and in particular
interfered with the Emma mine proceedings. While
I spoke as a private person, my charges might be disregarded,
but when a publication, reasonably responsible
in damages and absolutely responsible in a criminal
charge, made a downright allegation of fraud, that was
quite another thing. The libel laws of England were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
then, as now, airtight. It was not a jocular affair to
call anyone a thief in print, and those who did not
seek redress had to suffer under the suspicion, just or
unjust, that the accusation was substantially true. The
Emma mine was brought out in two sections, for promoting
each of which Baron Grant received a commission
of £100,000. When the first section was
issued it almost took a squad of policemen to keep
back the crowd of investors. The second appeared just
after the Stock Exchange Review began to hammer.
While the stock was taken, the promotion staggered
and was never quite itself again. One thing it prevented
absolutely&mdash;the declaring of a great dividend&mdash;on
air&mdash;which would have sent the stock skyward like
a rocket. The managers had determined on this piece
of rascality, but doubtless fearing that I had certain
knowledge of the fact that not a dollar’s worth of precious
metal had been produced, this particular piece of
villainy was reluctantly abandoned.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, I began to have suspicions of the
integrity of Samson, the financial editor of the London
Times. I could not think he was ignorant of what
was going on in the Emma mine deal. His attitude
toward several shady promotions looked, to say the
least, queer. In the days of our intimacy Baron Grant
had more than once broadly intimated that he possessed
some kind of mysterious hold on Samson. Whenever
I suggested Samson’s name as a possible factor in
our enterprises he always said smilingly, “He’ll be all
right.” For some time previous I had a passionate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
yearning to get a look at the financial writer’s bank
account.</p>

<p>I communicated this desire to Alfred Rubery one day,
just as the expression of a wish. Rubery, who knew
all the ropes and all the ins and outs of London, pondered
a few moments and said he thought it might be
arranged. I was overjoyed at this intimation, but
could not exactly see how, though my friend had an
odd way of doing things seemingly impossible, in an
everyday fashion. He was of an impulsive character, a
most loyal, trusty and affectionate friend, yet nothing
on earth could ever jar him out of his marvelous British
self-possession. I remember one occasion in San
Francisco in the old Chapman days, when Rubery and
I were present at a certain meeting, when a wholesale
slaughter was on the point of taking place. Just at
the crisis I happened to glance at Rubery. He was
sitting in his chair with a bored, blasé expression on
his face, as if tragedies were so commonplace in his
life that they lacked interest and were positively wearisome.
This incident has nothing to do with the story
further than to illustrate the singular character of the
man&mdash;a mixture of dash and enthusiasm under strong
control.</p>

<p>At that time money could accomplish almost anything
in England. A few evenings after our conversation,
Mr. Rubery waited on me at my rooms, accompanied
by a dapper looking person, whom he introduced
as an official of the Bank of England, who had access
to the accounts kept there by Mr. Samson and who was
willing for a reasonable compensation to give me all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
the information concerning the same I might desire. To
which pleasing presentation the official of the Bank of
England gravely bowed.</p>

<p>Some conversation followed as to the terms and conditions.
The official wanted all that was coming, but
evidently did not wish to scare off a good customer by
an extravagant price. At last he got down to a cold
cash proposition. Would I consider, under all the circumstances,
£500 excessive for so delicate a service?</p>

<p>A bargain was struck readily enough. Much better
terms would have been cheerfully granted. The contracting
party underestimated his hand.</p>

<p>Through this person I secured an accurate statement
of Mr. Samson’s transactions. I even was shown
checks and cross checks, which I photographed for future
use. These proved beyond all question that Mr.
Samson was a beneficiary of the Emma mine promotion,
that he had profited largely by other deals, and,
in short, was faithless to the trust of his employer,
and trading on that trust.</p>

<p>Here loomed up the outlines of a great dramatic situation,
the unmasking of a conspiracy, the righting of
many wrongs, by which the villain of the play would
be confounded and the innocent come to their own.
Only the details needed rounding out to clear the atmosphere
and let the curtain fall.</p>

<p>I was deeply engaged in these great affairs when I
received a cable from Mr. Ralston. It was, in fact, a
letter. At the cable rates then in force, it cost over
$1,100. When I read it I felt assured that my old
friend had gone mad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span></p>

<p>It told me of a vast diamond field just discovered in
a remote section of the United States. His description
of it made Sinbad, the Sailor, look like a novice. He
said that diamonds of incalculable value could be gathered
in limitless quantities at nominal expense; that
they could be picked up on the ant hills; that at a low
estimate it was a $50,000,000 proposition; that he and
George D. Roberts, a well-known mining man, were in
practical control. Finally he almost demanded that I
should drop everything, take the next steamer and act
as general manager.</p>

<p>The extravagance of his language alone seemed to
me to indicate that he was laboring under some strange
delusion. However, diamonds or no diamonds, I was
in no position to stir. I cabled him briefly that my
business in London was of too vital importance to admit
of considering other engagements.</p>

<p>But that did not satisfy Ralston at all. Cable followed
cable, urging, imploring, beseeching me to come
on, which were invariably answered in the same way.
Still I was worried and perplexed. Rumors began to
float into London about the discovery of a vast diamond
field in the American continent, controlled by the great
California banker, W.&nbsp;C. Ralston. Many financiers
called on me for information, knowing our relations.
Among others, Baron Rothschild sought an interview.
He asked me what I knew about the diamond fields, and
I frankly showed him Mr. Ralston’s cables. He read
them with interest and asked me what I thought myself.
I told him that while I had great confidence in Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
Ralston, I thought he must have been imposed upon in
some way, and that in due season the bubble would burst.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>BARON ROTHSCHILD</p>

<p>Head of the great financial institution

<p>Baron Rothschild mused a moment. “Do not be so
sure of that,” he said. “America is a very large country.
It has furnished the world with many surprises
already. Perhaps it may have others in store. At any
rate, if you find cause to change your opinion, kindly
let me know.”</p>

<p>This remark, made by perhaps the keenest financier
in the world, was enough to set any one thinking hard.</p>

<p>My position was one of extreme difficulty. The most
important engagements of my life demanded my presence
in London. Of course I knew that in my absence
everything must mark time. But little by little the impression
began to grow on me that Mr. Ralston had
actually captured a fifty million dollar financial circus
and that I was badly needed as ringmaster. His cables
did not deal in hopes, but absolute certainties&mdash;assured
facts. The diamonds were not a dream&mdash;a small fortune
of them taken from an insignificant trench were
already in his possession. Finally came a cable begging
me to go to California, if only for the briefest
stay, say sixty or ninety days.</p>

<p>I had engaged offices in London for seven years. I
could see ahead a vast future of activity and success,
and I did not want my selected career broken into by
outside distractions, however brief. But I commenced
to take the appeals of Mr. Ralston more seriously.
Casual expressions of opinion such as the one noted by
Baron Rothschild began to stir up my imagination a bit.
Could it really be true that there was a place where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
diamonds could be picked up on ant hills? It was very
easy to find out the truth, and if the truth happened to
correspond with Mr. Ralston’s statements, then everything
else in the world in the way of business or enterprise
seemed commonplace and cheap.</p>

<p>I laid the matter before Alfred Rubery, who usually
had a level head. He was surprised at my reluctance.
“You have your men safely trapped here,” he said.
“There is no possibility of escape, and whether they
enjoy for a brief time a sense of fancied freedom, matters
not in the least. Make up your mind to go to California
and find out what all this cable correspondence
means. Personally, I am bored to death, just pining
for a little bit of excitement. I will go along with you
and we will stir up things again in the Far West.”</p>

<p>Pressure came on every side. I must have had a
forewarning of disaster to have hesitated so long, but
finally I gave way to forces that seemed like fate. I
cabled Ralston that I would be at his service for a brief
period, but that the proceedings must be short and
sweet. Also I made a hurried arrangement of my affairs
in London, thinking to take up the thread again
in three months at most. Rubery was rejoiced at my
decision, and prepared to go along. We turned our
backs on London, stayed not on the order of our going
when we reached New York, and as fast as steamships
and railroads would carry us, arrived in San Francisco
some time during the month of May, 1872, prepared to
uncover the greatest diamond field in the world or return
whence we came with equal expedition.</p>

Field, But Report of Agent Satisfies Promoters.</span><br /><br />

<i>Final Proof of Good Faith Is Offered in Form of
Bag Filled With Collection of Eye-Dazzling Gems.</i></span></h2>

<p>When I arrived in San Francisco I lost no time in
getting in touch with the principals of the diamond
deal. Three prominent men only were concerned in it
at that time, W.&nbsp;C. Ralston, George D. Roberts and
William M. Lent. From them I learned that the alleged
discovery of the diamond fields had been known to
them for many months. Two prospectors, Philip Arnold
and John Slack, were the original locators. I had
known Arnold previously in California. He had been
employed by Roberts to look into mining properties in
the western country. The later story that he had once
been employed by myself in a like capacity was absolutely
false. Slack I had known as a plain man about
town, of general fair repute.</p>

<p>As an earnest of the great value of the fields, the
gentleman had, as near as I can recollect, a large quantity
of rough, uncut, brilliant-looking stones which they
said local experts had pronounced diamonds of an estimated
value of $125,000. Among them were several
magnificent reddish-colored stones, said to be rubies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
Moreover, they claimed that the discoveries had been
verified to an extent sufficient to satisfy themselves.</p>

<p>The story, previous to my arrival, I only know by
hearsay and I cannot vouch for every detail of things
beyond my personal experience that happened forty
years ago. But as nearly as I can recall the narrative,
as it was related, the main facts were these:</p>

<p>One day, in the year 1871, when I was in Europe,
two weather-beaten men, looking like typical miners,
presented themselves at the Bank of California and
arranged to deposit property of great value for safe
keeping. The property proved to be nothing more than
some handsome-looking stones which they said in explanation
were diamonds, of which they had discovered
a great store, in the desert section of the West. They
were given a receipt for their valuables and quietly took
their leave. But, of course, in those days of mad excitement
and crazy speculation, such an incident was
bound to leak. George D. Roberts located, in his old
prospector Arnold, one of the fortunates, and introduced
him to Ralston and Lent. Arnold was always the
spokesman, the negotiator, in these early transactions.
Slack merely was present and acquiesced. At first the
men were exceedingly coy and cautious, had all the
manner of a couple of simple-minded fellows who had
stumbled on something great and, bewildered with their
good fortune, were simply afraid to trust anyone with
the momentous secret. They declined to give the slightest
indication of the locality of the fields, or left the
impression that they were distant a thousand miles, or
thereabouts, from the actual spot. Relying on vague<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
hints, several parties actually set out for Arizona to
locate the new Golconda. At the outset the men refused
to part with their rights, except to the extent of
a small interest, and only then for a large sum of money
which they asserted was necessary to secure claims to
a very large territory.</p>

<p>Later, however, they became more amenable to reason.
They were willing to part with a half interest to gentlemen
in whom they had such implicit confidence.
When it was pointed out to them that negotiations
were impossible, unless the location of the mines was
indicated and some kind of an inspection allowed, they
offered a rather strange arrangement, which, however,
seemed fair enough on its face. By its terms they
agreed to conduct two men, to be selected by Ralston
and Roberts, to the diamond fields, and allow them to
satisfy themselves of the general nature of the find, but
with this proviso: that these representatives, after reaching
the wild, uninhabitable country, must submit to being
blindfolded, both going and coming back. These conditions
were agreed to and such an expedition was actually
made. I am not certain, but my impression is
that David D. Colton was one of the two investigators,
being selected by Mr. Ralston as a peculiarly level-headed
man of large practical experience. However
that may be, the mines were certainly visited and displayed,
more diamonds were unearthed, and the party
returned with the most rose-colored reports of the genuineness
of the properties and their fabulous richness.
It was this report that set Ralston and his associates
wild.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span></p>

<p>I had some knowledge of the prospectors. Arnold
generally had borne a good reputation among the mining
fraternity. Slack seemed to be a stray bird who
had blown in by chance, probably picked up by Arnold
because of a marriage relationship. It seemed that they
had told a straight enough story. It was impossible to
tangle them in any detail. Still I had a general, indefinable
doubt, which I expressed in plain words to
Ralston.</p>

<p>Before I arrived the men made a proposition that
seemed eminently fair. This was an offer to go to the
diamond fields and bring to San Francisco a couple of
million dollars’ worth of stones and place them in our
possession as a guaranty of good faith. Such a tender
was, of course, accepted. Slack and Arnold left San
Francisco, promising to be back in record-breaking time.</p>

<p>Shortly after I arrived Ralston received a telegram
from Arnold dated at Reno, stating that he and Slack
were on the way and urging that somebody meet them
at Lathrop, presumably to share in the heavy burden
of responsibility. After a hurried conference I was
asked to meet our emissaries as per request, and they
were so advised by wire. At the same time a later conference
was arranged at my residence. After my marriage
in 1866 I had bought the fine family home of
Mr. Ralston on Rincon Hill. There my friends were
to await my coming till the overland train arrived.</p>

<p>I had a long wait at Lathrop, but at last the expected
overland pulled in. I located the men without
difficulty. Both were travel-stained and weather-beaten
and had the general appearance of having gone through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
much hardship and privation. Slack was sound asleep
like a tired-out man. Arnold sat grimly erect like a
vigilant old soldier with a rifle by his side, also a bulky-looking
buckskin package.</p>

<p>Slack soon awoke and we discussed the business in
hand in low tones. The men told a rather lurid story,
but yet not improbable in its way. They said they had
luckily struck a spot which was enormously rich in stones,
which they estimated to be worth two million dollars,
that these had been done up for convenience in two
packages, one for each; that on their way home they
found the water in a river they had to cross extremely
high, and for purposes of safety had constructed a raft,
had nearly been upset, had lost one of the bags of diamonds,
but as the other contained at least a million
dollars’ worth of stones, it ought to be fairly satisfactory.</p>

<p>Slack and Arnold left the train at Oakland, turning
over the sack of diamonds on my bare receipt. It was
an awkward, burdensome bundle to handle on the ferryboat.
Arrived at San Francisco, my carriage was waiting
and drove me swiftly to my home. An eager group
was assembled. We did not waste time on ceremonies.
A sheet was spread on my billiard table, I cut the elaborate
fastenings of the sack and, taking hold of the
lower corners, dumped the contents.</p>

<p>It seemed like a dazzling, many-colored cataract of
light.</p>

Collection of Diamonds to Great Authority on
Gems.</span><br /><br />

<i>Tiffany Consults His Lapidary and Soon Makes Report
That Creates Big Stir in Speculative Circles.</i></span></h2>

<p>I think it was the next day or the day following that
a display of diamonds was made in the office of William
Willis that filled San Francisco with astonishment.
The precious stones were actually displayed in open trays
to a multitude of sightseers, until I bought a show-case
and gave them some kind of protection. General Dodge,
a partner of Lent in mining, bought an interest from
the prospectors at once, and Maurice Dore also acquired
a small holding, although I do not remember exactly
what.</p>

<p>Hitherto there had been no attempt made at organization.
It was generally understood that Ralston, Lent,
Roberts and myself owned three-quarters of the properties
by virtue of money already advanced and to be
advanced. For that there seemed to be ample security
in the gems we held. The last invoice alone appeared
to be security many times over for our cash outlays,
to say nothing of the probable value of the diamond
fields. So we prepared to get our affairs into business
shape, without further delay, and for that purpose held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
a meeting at which all concerned were present. The
plan of action was to follow these lines: First we were
to send a large sample of the diamonds to Tiffany, of
New York, then, as now, the greatest American authority
on precious stones, and have them thoroughly
examined and appraised. If their value were proved beyond
peradventure, then Messrs. Ralston, Lent, Roberts,
Dodge and myself were to choose a mining expert to
whom Arnold and Slack agreed to exhibit the diamond
fields and permit a full examination of the same.</p>

<p>Nothing could possibly be fairer to all, and Arnold
and Slack easily consented to these conditions, without
a moment’s hesitation. On the favorable outcome of
the valuation and the engineer’s report concerning the
diamond deposits, we agreed to take care of the financial
end. Not connected with any agreement with Arnold
or Slack, was a plan to facilitate the passage of a law
whereby a great territory of mining land could be taken
up so as to insure to ourselves the entire field, no matter
what the extent. The outline of a corporation was
sketched, with a capital stock of $10,000,000 and the
allotment of shares to each arranged and defined.</p>

<p>These preliminaries being settled, we set out for
New York without delay. In the party were William
Lent, General Dodge, Rubery, Arnold, Slack and myself.
It had been arranged beforehand in a general way that
Mr. Lent should be president and myself general manager.</p>

<p>We first retained Samuel Barlow, a leader of the
New York bar, as general counsel. Mr. Barlow’s reputation
as a sound business adviser was no less assured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
than his standing as a great trial lawyer. On his advice
we added General B.&nbsp;F. Butler to our legal staff. I
had some southern prejudice against Butler on account
of the spoon story in New Orleans, but when I came
to know the gentleman I found him to be very companionable
and quite a social genius in his way. A
side reason for employing General Butler was because
he was a member of Congress and perhaps able to aid
us materially in legislation needed to acquire the diamond
fields, as later proved to be the case.</p>

<p>Through Mr. Butler, an arrangement was made to
meet Mr. Tiffany at the lawyer’s house. My counsel
had some eye to stage effects. A number of distinguished
men were present to see the gems displayed.
Among them I remember General George B. McClellan,
Horace Greeley, Mr. Duncan, of the banking house of
Duncan, Sherman &amp; Co., Mr. Tiffany, General B.&nbsp;F.
Butler, and the host. I opened the bag of diamonds I
had brought from California; also there were mixed in
a few rubies, emeralds and sapphires. Mr. Tiffany
viewed them gravely, sorted them into little heaps, held
them up to the light, looking every whit the part of a
great connoisseur. “Gentlemen,” he said, “these are
beyond question precious stones of enormous value.
But before I give you the exact appraisement, I must
submit them to my lapidary, and will report to you
further in two days.”</p>

<p>Within two days Mr. Tiffany presented his report.
In an official statement, still available, his valuation on
the lot was $150,000. My own recollection is that he
named a much higher sum. However, let it go at that.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
At that figure, we had diamonds enough already in stock
to make up a total of $1,500,000 in hard cash, whenever
we wanted to turn them into money. That certainly
seemed a very satisfactory financial basis&mdash;regular velvet
to begin with. The news of the Tiffany appraisement,
though not intended for public consumption, soon became
common property in New York and made a big
stir in speculative circles. The hardier class of plungers
were only too eager to get aboard even at this early
stage of the game.</p>

<p>All that remained now was the choice of a mining expert.
One name naturally suggested itself&mdash;Henry
Janin.</p>

<p>Henry Janin bore at that time in the financial world
about the same reputation that John Hays Hammond
enjoys to-day. As a great mine expert and consulting
engineer, he was without a peer in the United States,
perhaps in the world. Nearly all the big operators like
Haggin, Hayward and their class were willing to stake
their fortunes on his judgment. It was said of Janin
that he had the record of having examined something
over six hundred mines, without once making a mistake,
certainly without ever having caused his clients to lose a
dollar by his bad judgment. If he had any failing at all,
it was on the side of ultra-conservatism. Some complained
that he never took a chance&mdash;that he even turned
down good mines, to strengthen the confidence of the
greatest investing classes, both in the old world and
the new. The O.&nbsp;K. of Henry Janin fixed the reputation
of a mining property in every market.</p>

<p>Therefore there could not have been selected a better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
equipped expert, so far as the financial world knew, to
settle finally the existence of the diamond fields. Mr.
Janin was interviewed. He was a man of big affairs,
whose time was well occupied. But he agreed to make
the examination provided the time to be consumed did
not exceed a month. He was also a very high-priced
professional. His best terms were $2,500 cash, all expenses
paid, and a right to take up 1,000 shares of the
stock at a nominal price. I may add here that Mr.
Janin later on sold his stock, while the excitement was in
full bloom, for $40,000. Mr. Lent rebelled and protested
against this arrangement as excessive, but was overruled.
He and I afterwards purchased Mr. Janin’s stock.</p>

<p>At this stage of the proceedings Arnold became
restive. He said he was placing his property at the
mercy of others without proper security, that what he
had received was a trifle compared to the value he was
about to disclose and that he must have a further guarantee
in cold cash. He named a hundred thousand dollars
as the amount that must be paid down, but agreed
to let it remain in escrow, pending Mr. Janin’s report.
Some quick writing went on between Mr. Lent and Mr.
Ralston, as the result of which the latter transmitted
the amount by telegraphic order; Mr. Lent holding the
diamonds appraised by Tiffany at $150,000 as a further
and final security. This was not exactly according to
program, but the transaction was fairly business-like and
did not present itself as a hold-up.</p>

<p>All our arrangements and differences in New York
were settled in a very brief space of time and we set out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
in high spirits on the way to the mysterious diamond
land. The party consisted of Henry Janin, General
George S. Dodge, Alfred Rubery, myself and Arnold
and Slack.</p>

<p>Our friends in San Francisco had, of course, been
advised by wire of our transactions and movements, including
the date of our departure. We had not journeyed
far before we received on the train a telegram
that George D. Roberts and a considerable party were
on the way to join us to visit the diamond fields and
would meet us, if I recollect aright, at Omaha. Here
again, Arnold absolutely rebelled. He had kept all his
engagements, he said. The diamonds had been appraised
by an expert of our own selection. He was
now on his way with the mining engineer chosen by us
and with the appointed representatives of the San Francisco
interests to exhibit the diamond fields and permit
any kind of examination we wished to make; but he was
not willing to expose his hand to the whole world until
other business arrangements were complete.</p>

<p>It seemed to me that Arnold’s argument was unanswerable.
Before we left San Francisco, every detail
had been arranged. This was a plain departure from
the plan. I took sides with Arnold. In fact, there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
nothing else to do, for he insisted that everything was
off unless we conceded to his wishes. Besides, I had
every faith in Janin’s ability to pass on the genuineness
of the diamond fields. Accordingly a telegram was sent
that turned Roberts and his party back.</p>

<p>We left the Union Pacific Railroad at a small station
near Rawlings Springs. Here we hired the necessary
outfit and struck out in the wilderness, Arnold and Slack
leading the way. Our course was erratic. At times our
leaders seemed to be perplexed, to have lost their way.
At times they climbed high peaks, apparently in search
of landmarks. The country was wild and inhospitable.
We suffered during four days’ travel many inconveniences.
The party became cross and quarrelsome. At
last, on the fourth day, early in the morning, Arnold
set out alone, to get his bearings, as he said. He returned
about noon, said everything was all right, and
we set out again with high hopes. By four o’clock we
pitched camp on the famous diamond fields.</p>

<p>The spot was at a high elevation, about 7,000 feet
above sea level, I think. Physically, it embraced a
small mesa or rather gently sloping basin, littered here
and there with rocks comprising about thirty or forty
acres, through which a small stream of water ran. It
was located in one of the most unfrequented parts of
the United States, although, as it afterwards proved,
Arnold and Slack in their zig-zag course, had actually
brought us nearly parallel with the railroad and not
more than twenty or twenty-five miles from it. In fact,
once, while we were at the mines, on a very still day, I
thought I heard something in the far distance that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
sounded like the ghost of a whistle. When I mentioned
this to Arnold, he merely smiled. The railroad was at
least a hundred miles away, he said.</p>

<p>But at all events we were mighty glad to reach our
destination and now everything was sidetracked to begin
the diamond hunt. We barely unsaddled our animals
and secured them; then commenced to hunt diamonds.
Arnold and Slack were serene and confident. They
pointed out several spots where they had previously
dug and found the precious stones, already mined
and delivered in San Francisco. We all went to work
with our primitive mining implements&mdash;picks, shovels
and pans. Everyone wanted to find the first diamond.
After a few minutes Rubery gave a yell. He held up
something glittering in his hand. It was a diamond, fast
enough. Any fool could see that much. Then we began
to have all kinds of luck. For more than an hour, diamonds
were being found in profusion, together with
occasional rubies, emeralds and sapphires. Why a few
pearls weren’t thrown in for good luck I have never
yet been able to tell. Probably it was an oversight.</p>

<p>You may depend upon it that we were in a happy
mood that night. There wasn’t the usual row over who
should cook supper, who should wash the dishes, who
should care for the stock, which little incidents of
camp life had brought us to the verge of bloodshed
during the three previous days. On the contrary, good
will and benevolence were slopping over. Arnold and
Slack had excellent reason to be satisfied. Mr. Janin
was exultant that his name should be associated with
the most momentous discovery of the age, to say nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
of the increased value of his 1,000 shares; while
General Dodge, Rubery and myself experienced the intoxication
that comes with sudden accession of boundless
wealth.</p>

<p>The next day prospecting was resumed and covered
a wide range. Everywhere we found precious stones&mdash;principally
diamonds&mdash;although a few sparklers of other
kinds were interspersed. It was quite wonderful how
generally the gems were scattered over a territory about
a quarter of a mile square and of course we were only
doing surface examination. No one could tell what depth
might produce.</p>

<p>Accounts have been published to the effect that when
we arrived at the diamond fields there were visible evidences
of the ground having been tampered with and
disturbed. This is absolutely absurd on its face. In the
first place any such evidence would have excited the suspicion
of the keen-eyed Janin in a moment. Secondly,
such a clumsy method of “salting” was unthinkable.
Undoubtedly holes were made in the soil with sharp
iron rods, gems were dropped in the holes, which were
closed by a hard stamp of the foot and the first winter’s
rain obliterated every trace that remained of human
agency. Wherever we worked, the ground was “in
place.”</p>

<p>Two days’ work satisfied Janin of the absolute genuineness
of the diamond fields. He was wildly enthusiastic.
It was useless, he said, to spend more time on that
particular piece of property&mdash;that was proved. The important
thing was to determine how much similar land
was in the neighborhood, and be able to seize on everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
in sight, for Mr. Janin pointed out that this new
field would certainly control the gem market of the
world and that the all-essential part of the program
was for one great corporation to have absolute control.</p>

<p>So we started on a widely extended prospecting trip.
Arnold and Slack did not care to go along, and, to tell
the truth, we weren’t very anxious for their company.
We saw much landscape, also much land that exactly
resembled the formation at the diamond mine. We
staked off in a rough way an enormous stretch of the
country, set up notices of claims that we hoped would
hold things down and covered what we believed to be
the entire diamondiferous area.</p>

<p>We returned to the original treasure fields and found
Arnold and Slack patiently waiting. Some discussion
arose over the vast values we were leaving behind us
unguarded and the urgent necessity to place some one in
charge. Slack was willing enough to stay, and Dodge
and Janin begged me to induce Rubery to remain with
him. This Rubery rebelled against lustily. He had
come on a pleasure trip&mdash;nothing more. But he was a
most accommodating man at heart, and finally gave in.
So we rode away from the diamond fields, leaving
Rubery and Slack on guard. I never saw Slack afterwards&mdash;what
became of him is a dark mystery that I will
take up later on.</p>

<i>Company to Develop Diamond Fields Includes Great
Lords of Finance and One Noted Union General.</i></span></h2>

<p>We returned direct to New York; that is to say, all
of the original party except Rubery and Slack. Of
course, Mr. Ralston was advised by wire of the substantial
results of our examination. Likewise, of course,
we advised our New York friends who had been previously
in our confidence, that our best expectations were
exceeded. Where so many are cognizant of a secret,
it very soon becomes public property, and in a brief
space of time all New York and, for the matter of that,
all the civilized world, knew that vast diamond fields
had been discovered on the North American continent,
had been inspected by a mining engineer of great reputation
and pronounced genuine. Something like the profound
excitement that stirred the mighty Argonaut
movement began to take form everywhere.</p>

<p>As an evidence of this fact, almost immediately after
I had reached New York, Baron Rothschild of London,
who had previously made inquiries of us, arranged for
what amounted to a cable interview. He informed me
that he had just received a cable from Mr. Ralston.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
(This, I presume, related to the agency he accepted at a
later date.) He stated further that he had heard of the
Tiffany appraisement, also that I had personally made a
visit to the mines with a leading expert. He wished me
to confirm the result of our observations. I answered
Baron Rothschild that half the truth had not been told;
that the diamond fields were rich beyond calculation;
that every doubt and shadow of a doubt had been absolutely
removed, so far as I was concerned. The Baron
thanked me, saying he was pleased to hear the good
news.</p>

<p>In fact, after the Tiffany valuation, the personal examination
of the mines and the statements of Mr. Janin
before he promulgated his famous report, every suspicion
gave way to an unbounded enthusiasm. Mr. Lent
afterward made a written statement, still in existence,
that Mr. Janin assured him he could wash out a million
dollars’ worth of diamonds a month with the assistance
of twenty rough laborers. Mr. Janin never went that
far with me; in fact, he afterward questioned the entire
accuracy of Mr. Lent’s figures, and Mr. Lent himself admitted
that he might have made an error. But before
leaving the diamond fields Mr. Janin assured me that the
discovery location alone, which we had partially examined,
was certainly worth many million dollars, with
countless possibilities besides.</p>

<p>Who wouldn’t become enthusiastic with such a showing?
It fired the imagination of all financialdom. It
upset the caution of the wisest heads in the old world, as
well as in the new. There was a wild scramble to get on
board, almost at any price.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span></p>

<p>Some statements have been made to the effect that I
used my influence to have the headquarters of the company
at New York instead of San Francisco. There is
this much truth to the statement, that it was debated
very seriously. This was a plain matter of business, a
question of dollars and cents&mdash;not patriotism. In launching
a concern of such tremendous importance, probably
destined to affect profoundly a vast industry, it is always
deemed vital to have the support of the largest
financial center possible. New York was then, as now,
the great haunt of capital in the United States. Many
of its leading men were only too anxious to identify
themselves with the new exploitation. I did not think
that the question of headquarters was one deserving
mature consideration, especially inasmuch as San Francisco,
controlling the stock issues, would necessarily be
the great beneficiary in the long run.</p>

<p>But this point was easily settled. Mr. Ralston and
myself owned a majority of the property. This we
had held from the outset. I simply telegraphed to Mr.
Ralston, laying the matter before him, without prejudice.
Mr. Ralston’s answer was decisive. He said that San
Francisco stood ready to furnish any amount of capital
required. There was no further argument on that head.
To San Francisco the headquarters went, but this much
was conceded to New York&mdash;that branch offices were
to be maintained in that city, and that Samuel P. Barlow
and General George B. McClellan were to be resident
directors; which arrangement was later carried out.
The New York connection was clearly indicated by the
company’s name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span></p>

<p>The scene now shifted to San Francisco, where Mr.
Ralston had the situation well in hand. A company was
regularly organized under the laws of California, entitled
the San Francisco and New York Mining and Commercial
Company, with a capital stock of $10,000,000,
divided into 100,000 shares. Its powers were of the
largest possible description; not alone to engage in the
business of mining and owning mines and their accessories,
but also to engage in every class of commercial
business, including the preparation of precious stones for
the general market. The apparent intention of the
organizers was to move the great lapidary establishments
of Amsterdam to the Pacific Coast, and the truth is
that this design caused no small concern in the Low
Countries, where the cutting of gems is an industry
hundreds of years old.</p>

<p>San Francisco was certainly ripe for the new company.
Hardly a business man of any considerable wealth
would not have considered it a rare privilege to be
admitted to participation in the enterprise on the
ground floor. It was only a case of choosing the highest
class of names in the community, to launch the great
undertaking under the most brilliant auspices. Twenty-five
gentlemen, representing the cream of the financial
interests of the city of San Francisco, men of national
reputation for high-class business standing and personal
integrity, were permitted to subscribe for stock to the
amount of $80,000 each, and this initial capital of $2,000,000
was immediately paid to the Bank of California.</p>

elected directors, with headquarters at the City of New
York. Mr. Lent was then chosen president, W.&nbsp;C. Ralston,
treasurer, and William Willis, secretary. David
D. Colton resigned from his position with the railroad
to become general manager.</p>

<p>Only old timers can recognize what these names
meant. All the owners of them are long since dead.
Some of them went into a financial eclipse before they
died. But in 1872 they stood as the last word in the
financial and commercial world of the Pacific Coast.
I might mention here for the benefit of the later generation
that A. Gansl was the representative of the House
of Rothschild on the Pacific Coast.</p>

<p>Such was the lineup. The biggest men of San Francisco
were solidly behind the enterprise. Two distinguished
citizens of New York represented the company
as resident directors there, and in the Old World the
famous house of Rothschild became the company’s agents.
The interest of Slack and Arnold was wiped out finally
by a cash payment of $300,000, which was turned over
to Arnold personally, he having a properly executed
power of attorney to act for Slack. Thus, the decks
were cleared.</p>

Wild Tale of Single Gem as Big as a Pigeon’s
Egg.</span><br /><br />

<i>Winter Causes Lull, But Cold Fails to Chill the Ardor
of Men Counting on Millions in Spring.</i></span></h2>

<p>On July 30, 1872, the articles of incorporation of the
San Francisco and New York Mining and Commercial
Company were formally filed and the report of Expert
Janin was made public. As yet, however, the exact
location of the diamond fields was undisclosed, because
the company’s rights to the great territories claimed were
not completed, although a recent act of Congress changing
the mining laws gave ample opportunity. The wildest
tales concerning the new discoveries were at once
turned loose. An article in the New York Sun, signed
“Old Miner,” located the exact position of the fields
somewhere in Southeastern Arizona, a guess that happened
to be out of the way by some seven or eight hundred
miles. The “Old Miner” further stated that the
company had in its possession a single gem larger than
a pigeon’s egg, of matchless purity of color, worth at a
low estimate $500,000. You may be sure that this
started a good-sized stampede for Arizona.</p>

<p>The directors had several meetings and decided to
proceed with extreme circumspection. For one thing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
they sent a large consignment of diamonds to the House
of Rothschild in London for examination and sale. At
the same time a party of fifteen, including miners, surveyors
and others interested, were dispatched to the diamond
fields for the purpose of exploring, surveying
and securing our rights. In the meantime not a share
of stock was placed on the market, although the excitement
was intense.</p>

<p>I append an extract from a morning paper of the day
following the incorporation and making public Janin’s
radiant report:</p>

<p>(Alta, Aug. 1, 1872.)&mdash;“American Diamond Fields.
One Thousand Diamonds Now in This City. Also Four
Pounds of Rubies and Large Sapphires.</p>

<p>“We have a wonderful story to tell. We listened to it
at first with incredulity, but after hearing all our informant
had to say we found reasons for believing it.
We have seen a report written by Henry Janin, a mining
engineer of an established reputation who had visited the
mines, examined them and reported favorably on them.
He has accepted the position of superintendent and has
expressed the opinion that with twenty-five men he will
take out gems worth at least $1,000,000 a month. In
this paper he attached so much importance to the discovery
that he discusses the question whether the price
of rubies and diamonds is likely to depreciate in consequence
of increased production and answers the question
in the negative. We have thus commenced with Mr.
Janin because he is well known here and it is mainly
on his statements that confidence rests. His statements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
evidently command confidence, for some of the leading
capitalists of the State have purchased stock.</p>

<p>“The place of the new mines has not been communicated
to us by any of the interested parties, but street
rumor says it is New Mexico. About three years ago,
they say, an Indian near the diamond deposits gave
several diamonds and rubies to a white man who
brought them to Messrs. Roberts and Harpending in San
Francisco. These gentlemen satisfied themselves of the
value of the gems and sent men to hunt for more. They
met the Indian after a long search, he took them to the
place and was subsequently drowned. We tell the story
as it was told to us.</p>

<p>“Then Mr. Janin went to the spot, washed a ton and
a half of gravel, took out 1000 diamonds, four pounds
of rubies and a dozen sapphires, and selected the best
ground for mining. Three thousand acres were claimed
under the mining law passed last session. The country
for a considerable distance around was examined, but
no equally promising deposit was found.</p>

<p>“Most of the diamonds found by Mr. Janin are small,
weighing a karat. One obtained previously weighed
over 100 karats, but was dark and of little value relatively.
There are 109 karats in an avoirdupois ounce,
so that a diamond weighing a karat is a small affair,
yet if clear and well shaped may be worth from $25 to
$50.... Some of the sapphires are as large as
pigeon eggs.</p>

<p>“The diamond mines are the property of the San
Francisco and New York Mining and Commercial
Company, which has been incorporated, and the directors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
are M.&nbsp;S. Latham, A. Gansl, W.&nbsp;F. Babcock, Louis
Sloss, William M. Lent, T.&nbsp;H. Selby, Maurice Dore,
General George B. McClellan and Samuel L. Barlow, the
last two of New York. The company is incorporated
in this city. It has 100,000 shares of stock and they
have been selling at $40, making the present market
value of the whole property $4,000,000.</p>

<p>“This price indicates great expectations, as Mr. Gansl
is the agent of the Rothschilds and Mr. Latham of
prominent British capitalists. A party of miners will
go to the mines with tools and provisions for the winter’s
work and the extraction of gems will begin. The
stones are to be brought to San Francisco and cut here.”</p>

<p>But that was nothing compared with what followed,
when the last party returned from the fields on October
6. Previous to that Deacon Fitch had cautioned the
public more than once to go slow on the diamond craze.
But thereafter even he joined the procession joyously.
Witness this:</p>

<p class="p2">(From the Bulletin, Oct. 7, 1872.)</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The Diamond Fields&mdash;About the 20th of August a
party of fifteen men left this city to explore the diamond
fields about which there has been such a furore of excitement.
Amongst them were the following well-known
gentlemen: G.&nbsp;D. Roberts, General John W. Bost, M.
G. King, M.&nbsp;G. Gillette, Alfred Rubery, John F. Boyd,
Dr. C. Cleveland, E.&nbsp;M. Fry, Chauncey Fairfield and
Chas. G. Myers.</p>

<p>“The members of the expedition returned last evening.
They experienced no trouble with the Indians, but had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
a very tedious march to the fields and thence home. The
heads of the party declare that their explorations more
than confirmed the original report of Janin of the extent
and richness of the deposits and they exhibited specimens
which they say they secured with their own exertions
with but little labor. This party went merely to
explore and prospect the country where the diamonds
and rubies were said to abound and not for the purpose
of working. They say that active operations could not
be carried on when they were there, as the altitude is
great and the ground covered with snow. The specimens
they brought back are similar to those previously
exhibited in this city and they number 286 diamonds of
various sizes.</p>

<p>“Mr. Roberts says that if they had been deceived they
are the worst deceived and cheated men who ever lived.
They surveyed 3000 acres of land and propose to keep
secret the exact locality until the company receives a
Government patent. The implements used by them seem
to have been ordinary jackknives&mdash;an improvement on
the boot heels of the original locators. If so much
wealth can be turned up by such primitive means, what
might be accomplished with shovels and pickaxes? The
report of the party renewed the excitement and little
else is talked about on California street but diamonds
and rubies. A meeting of the trustees of the company
was called for 2 p.&nbsp;m. and further developments will be
awaited with interest. A fact that is so easily demonstrated
as the existence of diamonds in that country
should not be longer one of doubt and suspicion.”</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span></p>

<p>Of course, everything was closed down for the winter.
But every holder of the company’s stock figured on
being a millionaire at least by the early spring, from the
proceeds of his diamond field adventures.</p>

<p>I should have added that when we returned from the
diamond fields Mr. Janin took a package of the gems
we had found to Tiffany for valuation. We had estimated
them to be worth $20,000, but the jeweler scaled
this down to $8000. This didn’t disturb Janin. He
considered it a “bear” movement.</p>

<p>Just what might have happened in a single month of
wild speculation had the stock of the San Francisco and
New York Mining and Commercial Company been
placed in any considerable quantity on the market, is
hard to tell. But one thing is very certain&mdash;it would
have caused a catastrophe almost without parallel in the
civilized world. The public was keyed up to the point of
a speculative craze such as even the Comstock never
saw, not alone in San Francisco but in nearly every
financial center of the earth. Millions upon millions
would have been invested. The shares would have
soared to fabulous figures. Banks would have advanced
money on these prime securities, as was the custom in
those times. And then the awful crash! There would
have been more ruins in financialdom than San Francisco
exhibited after the fire. Every day the mails were
loaded with letters from eager correspondents making
inquiries for stock. The best and unanswerable proof
that everyone connected with the company acted in absolute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
good faith is to be found in the fact that not a
share changed hands.</p>

<div id="ip_233" class="figcenter" style="width: 273px;">

  <div class="caption"><p>LOUIS SLOSS</p>

<p>President Alaska Commercial Co.,<br />

<p>Meanwhile, however, handsome offices were engaged,
and David D. Colton was installed in all the dignity of
general manager. This was long before the date of
typewriters, and it required several clerks to answer
letters. A large map showing the general outlines and
physical characteristics of the 3000 acres claimed by the
company was displayed in the office. It showed the
relative position of Discovery Claim, Ruby Gulch, Diamond
Flat, Sapphire Hollow, and other locations with
names equally suggestive of wealth without limit. Many
longing eyes were cast on that map by would-be speculators.
The company had considered a plan for holding
and working what was known as Discovery Claim on its
own account, and granting concessions in the remaining
territory for so much down in cash and a royalty on the
gems recovered.</p>

<p>Some fifteen or more bona fide offers were made to
purchase a concession for $200,000 cash and a royalty
to the parent company of 20 per cent. Not only that,
but the purchasers of such concession would have been
able to place stock on the market and sell the shares
like hot cakes. Quite a few million could have been
gathered in from that source alone. Why not? Even
granting that the element of gambling was strong, nevertheless,
such a property had a far better backing of
apparent value than nine-tenths of the wildcat mining
schemes launched every week on the stock exchange.</p>

<p>Not only that, but three other diamond and ruby
companies were organized, each with fairly representative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
men behind them. One of these companies exposed
to public view a gem that looked like the headlight of a
locomotive, seen through a fog after dark. It was
known as the Staunton ruby, and was generally conceded
by experts to be a genuine stone of high quality.
No one seemed able to give more than a guess at its
value, but the opinion was unanimous that only some
rich and powerful nation could purchase it, to adorn a
scepter or a crown. All of these companies were merely
marking time, waiting till the great, proved, unquestioned
company should say “play ball” and start a speculative
market for everyone.</p>

<p>But no such misfortune happened. On November 11
a telegram was received from Clarence King by the
president of the San Francisco and New York Mining
and Commercial Company dated from a small station in
Wyoming stating that the diamond fields were fraudulent
and plainly “salted.” This, of course, caused a
wild excitement among the officers of the company.
They held a hurried meeting. They were simply stunned.
King was reached by wire at once, and agreed to take
a party in and prove his statements. A party was at
once organized for this purpose. The members were
Henry Janin, D.&nbsp;D. Colton, John W. Bost and E.&nbsp;M.
Fry.</p>

<p>Clarence King was a geologist and engineer in the
service of the United States Government, a man of some
professional distinction and of talent in the literary line.
It is worthy of note here that some years after the diamond
story broke, King wrote a perfervid narrative entitled
“Mountaineering in the High Sierras.” In it he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
described an ascent of Mount Whitney, the highest
peak in California, and dragged himself through a series
of hair-breadth escapes that put every Alpine adventure
in the shade. A geologist by the name of W.&nbsp;A. Goodyear
knew something of the region, visited Mount Whitney,
made the ascent on a mule with settled habits of
reflection and never dismounted till he reached the top,
proving that King had never been there at all. All of
this Goodyear described in a widely circulated magazine.
The laugh that followed broke King’s heart. He
died a few months later.</p>

<p>It was this same gentleman who late in the fall of
1872 made up his mind to have a look at the diamond
fields. Notwithstanding all of our attempted secrecy, almost
anyone could place his finger on our claims. Not
only that, but at least two men, Berry and McClellan,
had actually been at the fields, saw the old washings and
the tools left by the Roberts party, and it was one of
these who guided Mr. King to the spot.</p>

<p>Mr. King’s story makes the discovery of the fraud
rather a matter of deductive reasoning, whereby little
straws of evidence are put together one by one and
formed into the nest that holds the egg of proof. It
is easier to construct this nest afterwards than before.
I heard myself a somewhat different version of the
story. In company with Mr. King went a middle-aged
German, a sort of cross between a camp follower and a
friend. Like a “super” in a great dramatic performance,
he did not cut a very large figure. But many
years afterward I met him in New York and he told me
a very interesting story. On reaching the diamond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
fields, he said, notwithstanding the intense cold weather,
both he and Mr. King began washing for diamonds, and
naturally enough found what they were looking for. In
fact, the geologist came very near being fooled as badly
as anyone else&mdash;wanted to leave instantly, and thought
of going to San Francisco to have a talk with the directors
of the company. But the German gentleman felt
differently. He was not overburdened with wealth,
had never been in any place before where diamonds
could be picked up without even saying, “by your leave,”
and he was naturally averse to leaving a place so full of
delightful possibilities. So he arranged a brief respite
before departure. In the meantime he was washing
“dirt” to beat the band and every now and then pocketing
a sparkler that he valued at a small fortune. Suddenly
he came on a stone that caught his eye and filled
him with wonderment. It bore the plain marks of the
lapidary’s art. He took it immediately to his principal.
“Look here, Mr. King,” he said. “This is the bulliest
diamond field as never vas. It not only produces diamonds,
but cuts them moreover also.”</p>

<p>King grabbed the half-cut diamond. Everything was
clear as day. Beyond the peradventure of a doubt the
fields were salted. He hunted out evidence that he had
overlooked before, and very soon was in possession of
proof quite aside from the partly cut gem, that a wholesale
fraud had been committed.</p>

<p>I am not giving this story as a fact&mdash;simply offering it
for what it is worth, and certainly without any desire
to detract from the great service rendered by Clarence
King.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. King reached the diamond fields on November 2,
1872. On November 10 he was back to the railroad and
sent the famous dispatch&mdash;that the company was duped.</p>

<p>Also he waited for Messrs. Janin, Colton, Host and
Fry, the party sent from California. They went together
to the diamond fields and the now plain nature of the
plot was thoroughly exposed. It is not necessary to go
into any of Mr. King’s geological conclusions or the
entire evidence upon which the conclusion was reached.
Two or three facts are enough to indicate the satisfactory
nature of the proof.</p>

<p>Mention has been made of ant-hills sparkling with
minute but veritable diamond and ruby dust. Perhaps
because they were so pretty no one ever disturbed them.
But if somebody had taken a notion to give one of them
a kick their supposititious nature would have been apparent.
They weren’t ant-hills at all. They were fakes;
the work of a sinful man, not of the moral insect.
They were also works of art; no one would have suspected
guile from looking at them.</p>

<p>A close examination revealed three holes evidently
made with a stick or some sharp instrument, at the bottom
of each of which a gem rested. There is little
doubt that all the “salting” was done in this way, except
that as a rule the holes were carefully closed. But
in such extensive operations a little reckless work was
likely to slip in.</p>

<p>Finally, on the top of a large flat rock, several rubies
and diamonds were found pressed into crevices to hold
them in place. This was so grotesquely raw that it
seems incredible, and led to a story that some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
diamonds were in the forks of trees. Unfortunately for
the story, there weren’t any trees in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>The party returned to San Francisco late in November.
On the 25th of that month the general facts were
given to the press, that the diamond fields were a fraud,
and that everyone had been taken in. The excitement
was intense. The Associated Press kept the wires humming
with the news for days, transmitting fuller reports
than were published here, although the local papers
printed whole pages. Wherever a printing press ran,
the world knew the story of the diamond fraud.</p>

<p>The trustees of the San Francisco and New York
Mining and Commercial Company held various meetings
and a select investigating committee was appointed. W.
H.&nbsp;L. Barnes was the company’s regular attorney.
Messrs. Hall McAllister and S.&nbsp;M. Wilson were added
to the staff to ferret out and punish those guilty of the
fraud. Everyone connected with the early history of the
transaction gave testimony, every line of evidence was
hunted down.</p>

<p>Among other things, an accomplice came forward by
the name of Cooper, who admitted with noble candor
that he was the author of the whole scheme, though
unrighteously deprived by his welching partners of his
just share of the spoils. Salting mines was the commonest
thing in the past, and isn’t yet to be classed with
the lost arts. Talking with Arnold and Clark, whom he
knew personally, of how the “salting” of gold and silver
mines had been overworked, he suggested the “salting”
of a diamond field as a pleasing variation, and told how
small diamonds, such as those used for drills, could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
be readily obtained. According to his story, Arnold and
Slack bit greedily and a triumvirate was formed to
carry on the fraud. This was nearly two years before
the Janin examination. Cooper was undoubtedly a confederate,
did a lot of advising and suggesting, but was
kept in the dark concerning the most important details.
Also, he was promised a liberal share in the booty and
his confession was prompted chiefly by a desire for revenge.
He gave Arnold and Slack the full credit for
everything.</p>

<p>The statement of Cooper was made not only to the
special investigating committee, but also to the grand
jury of San Francisco. The latter body indicted no one.</p>

<p>On November 27 the trustees of the San Francisco
and New York Mining and Commercial Company met
for the last time. At this session it made a final report
to the public, giving its brief history, the confidence
placed in Tiffany appraisement and the report of Janin;
the final statement that the properties it claimed to be
diamondiferous were “salted” and that everyone had
been cleverly duped. All its business was summarily suspended
and its attorneys ordered to wind up its business
at once.</p>

<p>Appended to the report were statements from Clarence
King, describing his discoveries, from Henry Janin,
confirming Clarence King, and admitting his former errors;
also from Messrs. Colton, Fry and Bost, all denouncing
the fraud.</p>

<p>If anything were lacking, news came from London
that the diamonds we had sent there were coarse, almost
valueless “niggerheads” from the South African fields,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
and had been purchased in bulk there from a dealer
nearly a year before, who identified them perfectly.</p>

<p>The late diamond millionaires, who had been rather
chesty, presented a sad spectacle on the street. They
were pursued everywhere with jibes and jokes. Some of
them went into retirement till the storm blew over. There
never was a better illustration of the joy to be found in
triumphing over the sorrow and discomfiture of others.</p>

Miners Managed to Deceive Men Like Tiffany
and Janin.</span><br /><br />

<i>Inquiry Reveals That “Salting” of Diamond Field Cost
Plotters $35,000 and Yielded $600,000 Net Profit.</i></span></h2>

<p>How so many of the shrewdest men in the world
could have been absolutely duped by the great diamond
fraud may well be asked. The truth is it succeeded not
because of the baleful craft employed in working out
its details, but because of a rawness that seemed to
disarm rather than arouse suspicion and the audacity
and nerve with which everything was carried out. That
diamonds, rubies, emeralds and sapphires were found
associated together&mdash;gems found elsewhere in the world
under widely different geological conditions&mdash;was a fact
that ought to have made a goat do some responsible
thinking. But it seems to have been entirely overlooked
by Tiffany, by Janin, by the house of Rothschild,
to say nothing of Ralston, Sam Barlow, General McClellan,
General Butler, William M. Lent, General
Dodge, the twenty-five hard-headed business men of
San Francisco who cheerfully invested $2,000,000 in
the stock and the fifteen mining men who accompanied
Mr. Roberts to the fields, after the San Francisco and
New York Mining and Commercial Company was organized.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
Had serious attention ever been directed to
that single point it certainly would have prompted
an investigation that must have ended in exposure.</p>

<p>Again, the Tiffany appraisement of $150,000 on not
more than a tenth of the gems actually on hand is hard
to comprehend, unless regarded in connection with another
fact&mdash;that valuing cut stones and valuing stones
in the rough are widely different matters. While the
Tiffany establishment had undoubted experts as to the
finished diamond, it is doubtful whether a single real
expert valuer of rough diamonds was to be found in the
United States. All the lapidary work of the world was
then done principally in Amsterdam, with smaller establishments
in Paris and London. As I understood later,
the Tiffany experts satisfied themselves that the stones
were actually diamonds, weighed them, estimated the
cost of cutting and net weight, applied the usual rules
for valuation, which increases enormously with the size
of the stone, made a large deduction and let it go at
that. Thus the total of $150,000 was arrived at. Knowing
the immense reserves we had in San Francisco, the
question of fraud probably never entered their minds.
For, although much ingenuity and some money had been
invested in the enterprise of palming off worthless
mining properties, it seemed the height of absurdity to
suppose that anyone had invested a million and a half
dollars in “salt.”</p>

<p>And, to do justice to Henry Janin, I think it was this
valuation that disarmed his suspicions and made him less
eager to search for traces of chicane. He said several
times on the journey to the diamond fields that he considered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
their genuine character established; that his
mission was mainly to estimate their extent and probable
value. As to that, the washings we made might well
have satisfied any man. Perhaps had he remained at the
discovery claim, instead of exploring the country in the
neighborhood, he might have detected traces of fraud.
But he considered the most essential thing was an examination
to determine the diamondiferous area, so that
his employers might ultimately get it all.</p>

<p>Yet the most convincing factor of all was the attitude
of the men themselves. Arnold was no ordinary mortal.
Throughout all the negotiations, coming in contact with
some of the most alert intellects of the time, he was
always serene, ready, confident&mdash;did not make a single
break. Besides he had an air of simple, rugged honesty
that impressed everyone he met. General Dodge, who
thought meanly of human nature, said in a printed interview
that he would stake his life on Arnold’s integrity.
Not only that, but Arnold and Slack were willing, even
eager, to submit the diamonds to any test and to lead a
party of experts to the fields, under proper guaranty
that their rights would be protected. They seemed almost
exultant when they understood that Tiffany would
value the diamonds. That, of course, would settle everything,
they said. They were equally delighted at the
choice of Janin as an expert. Both of them had the
dramatic gift highly developed. On the stage they might
have made the most famous actors of any time.</p>

<p>And how did a couple of ordinary prospectors secure
the very large sum undoubtedly used to finance the glittering
fraud? That was a question that puzzled many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
and led to all kinds of surmises about confederates,
syndicates, and so forth. But it was shown later that
in 1870 Arnold and Slack made a couple of lucky turns
at selling mines and actually had at one time in excess
of $50,000 to their credit in a Western bank. This deposit
was withdrawn in bulk and was never traced afterwards,
except in the purchase of diamonds in the markets
of Amsterdam and London.</p>

<p>Through the agency of I.&nbsp;W. Lees, this end of the
transaction was fully traced and the facts published.
Arnold made two trips to Europe to purchase gems.
Both times he shrewdly avoided American ports, sailing
and returning by way of Halifax. His first visit was
made in the fall of 1870. That time he confined his
activities to Amsterdam and showed great shrewdness
in concealing his tracks and avoiding suspicion. He
visited the various gem-cutting establishments, bought
many coarse stones, but not enough from any one firm
to make the transaction look unusual. No one seemed
to know his name, but his photograph was at once
identified by many diamond dealers of Amsterdam as the
eccentric person who seemed to have an unusual penchant
for inferior stones. He was regarded as a newly-rich
American with a vulgar taste for ostentation, who
wished to overburden his family and dazzle his fellow-countrymen
with a wealth of cheap, almost worthless
gems.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span></p>

<p>On his second trip in the early winter of 1872, Arnold
went direct to London, and there, while the conspiracy
was at the most ticklish point, he threw all caution to
the winds. One of the largest dealers in the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
metropolis gave the story to the press how one afternoon
a rather rough-looking American appeared at his
place of business and asked to be shown what they had
in the way of undergrade or rather refuse diamonds.
He was shown a large stock of South African stones of
the quality known as “niggerheads,” handsome enough,
but of very small commercial value. The American
pawed over them apparently without the least regard
for size or quality until he had collected a great pile.
Then he asked indifferently, “How much for the lot?”</p>

<p>The trader hadn’t the least conception that his customer
meant business. However, he made a rapid appraisement
of the stones and gave the price at £3000,
or $15,000. To his amazement, the American produced
a huge bank roll, counted off the money, had the
diamonds packed in small sacks, which he deposited in
the capacious pockets of an overcoat and elsewhere, said
good-day and departed. In the photograph of Arnold,
the English trader recognized his customer at once.</p>

<p>As near as anyone could estimate, about $35,000 was
invested in “salting” the claims. To this should be
added something for traveling expenses, etc. The men
received approximately $660,000. That left a little over
$600,000 net profit.</p>

Old Home in Kentucky to Enjoy Hard-Earned
Riches.</span><br /><br />

<i>Victims Bring Suit for $350,000, But Arnold Is Popular
With Neighbors and Forces Compromise.</i></span></h2>

<p>After Arnold received his final payment of $300,000
he retired to his old home at Elizabethtown in Hardin
county, Kentucky, bought a fine piece of land and also
a safe, which he kept in his house under strong guard.
In this he deposited nearly all his spoils, although he
also had a tidy balance in the local bank, which added
greatly to his repute among his neighbors. He had a
host of relatives in Hardin county, which borders on the
primitive section of Kentucky. It was there that the
most capable of Morgan’s guerrillas were recruited and
there most of them returned. Anyone hunting trouble in
that locality was almost sure to find it. Arnold settled
down quietly among his friends and relatives to enjoy the
fruits of a toilsome life.</p>

<p>His place of residence was well known. In fact, the
Kentucky papers gave some prominence to the return of
this famous discoverer of diamond fields to the home of
his ancestors. When the bubble burst, Mr. Lent hurried
to Kentucky, hired eminent counsel&mdash;Judge Harlan,
later a Justice of the Supreme Court of the United<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
States, and Benjamin Bristow, a lawyer of equal standing&mdash;brought
suit against Arnold for $350,000 on his
personal account and levied an attachment on his property.
All of these proceedings are set forth in the Louisville
Journal of December 18, 1872. Two days later the
same paper published a long statement from Arnold, in
which he denounced in unmeasured terms the outrage
that had been committed on his rights. He scored “Bill”
Lent in language of scant courtesy, but of picturesque
Western expressiveness, and declared he neither owed
him $350,000 nor the like number of cents, or any other
sum, for the matter of that.</p>

<p>Arnold went on to say that his safe contained $550,000,
the result of arduous labor as a prospector and
miner in the Far West, not to mention his bank account
and real estate. The sequestration of the same by a
shark or an aggregation of sharks from California he
looked upon as an outrage unparalleled in history. He
went into the diamond field story in detail, denied that
he had ever “salted” it or that it had ever been “salted”
at all. He appended Janin’s report, the Tiffany appraisement
and a long extract from the San Francisco Chronicle
to prove that he had turned over an absolutely valid
diamond property to the San Francisco and New York
Mining and Commercial Company, and that if anyone
“salted” it, the diabolical act must have been done after
the experts’ examination and by some of the “California
scamps.”</p>

<p>Did Arnold suffer any in the estimation of his compatriots
by reason of the grave accusations preferred
against him? Rather the reverse. They gloried in what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
they were pleased to call his “spunk.” The old Morgan
raiders and thousands of their way of thinking looked
with pride, almost with reverence, on one of their kind
with nerve and wit enough to make a foray into Yankeedom
and bring away more than half a million in spoils.
To tell the truth, Arnold was the very hero of the hour,
for the old war feeling was still rampant.</p>

<p>I followed Lent to Kentucky, whither also went Captain
I.&nbsp;W. Lees. Familiar with the field, after some
investigation of the state of public opinion in Hardin
county, I am satisfied that had Arnold stood his ground
unflinchingly not a dollar could have been wrung from
him by legal proceedings, no matter what the proof.
And, moreover, at that time the matter of exact proof
was not as easy as later on.</p>

<p>Negotiations leading to a compromise took place in
which I played a part. These resulted in a compromise
by which Arnold surrendered $150,000 on consideration
of immunity from further litigation. The money was
turned over to Mr. Lent personally. What disposition
was made of it I am not informed, but understood that
it was retained by the recipient to make good his personal
loss.</p>

<p>So Arnold, left, according to his own statements, with
an uncontested fortune of nearly half a million dollars,
everywhere enjoyed the esteem and high respect which
broadcloth and a large cash balance invariably inspire.
But he did not live long to enjoy prosperity. Arnold,
among other ambitions, wanted to shine in finance, and
for this purpose opened a bank in Elizabethtown, and
for a time did a rushing trade, to the great irritation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
his business rivals. The quarrel became very bitter, and
as differences of opinion were only arbitrated in one way
in Hardin county at the period mentioned, the first time
Arnold met one of his competitors the two opened fire
at each other on the street, after the manner of the best
traditions. Arnold never lacked courage, and had all the
best of the arbitration, having winged his man once,
when his antagonist’s partner appeared in a doorway
and landed the greater portion of a charge of buckshot
in the diamond discoverer’s shoulder. His wounds were
considered fatal, but his iron constitution carried him far
toward recovery, and he was considering with pleasant
anticipation a second meeting with the bankers, with
sixshooters instead of a clearing-house to balance the
account, when he was seized with pneumonia. Under
this last affliction the tough old campaigner, after a
hard struggle, weakened and died. This happened, I
think, near the close of 1873, so that Arnold’s prosperity
was short-lived.</p>

<p>What became of Slack? That was a question often
asked, but never answered in a satisfactory way. As I
said, the last time I ever saw him was when I left the
diamond fields with the Janin party. He and Rubery
remained behind. When these two separated Rubery
came to San Francisco, while Slack took an eastbound
train. Many attempts were made to locate him at a
later day. He was heard from at various points&mdash;St.
Louis, New Orleans, Memphis and Mobile. Always it
turned out to be another Slack. Finally the impression
became general that he must have gone abroad and hid
his identity in another land.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span></p>

<p>But the strange part of it was that Arnold had all the
money, or nearly all of it, as appears by his signed statements
and later by the inventory of his estate, which
corresponded. Granting every possible contingency, the
share of Slack was either practically nothing or very
small, not to exceed $30,000 at the utmost. As they
always figured as partners, and as Slack, though not the
spokesman, appeared a man of force, I have always considered
that a deep mystery hung over his fate. It seems
not unlikely that he died somewhere in the Western
country, probably among strangers, and never participated
in the profits of the diamond fraud at all.</p>

Dupes; Ralston Reimburses All Stockholders.</span><br /><br />

<i>Gossips Make Unjust Charge Against Men Who Acted
in Good Faith and Were Deceived by Swindlers.</i></span></h2>

<p>The losses growing out of the diamond fraud fell on
the shoulders of the original dupes&mdash;W.&nbsp;C. Ralston, William
M. Lent, George Dodge and myself. My impression
is that the money obtained by Mr. Lent from Arnold
very nearly, if not quite, balanced his account. Perhaps
he may have given a portion of this to General
Dodge, his business associate. Mr. Ralston promptly
paid the twenty-five stockholders who subscribed $2,000,000
for a half interest in the company, dollar for dollar.
Not a man of them lost a cent. This involved a sacrifice
of the last $300,000 paid to Arnold and Slack. Mr.
Ralston had the receipts in full of the various parties
neatly framed and I am told that it was one of the
mural decorations of his private office in the Bank of
California. The remaining balance of loss was borne by
Mr. Roberts and myself.</p>

<p>The diamond fraud story has covered acres of newspaper
space. This, however, is the first time that the
narrative has been told from start to finish, all the facts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
assembled in connected form. From what has gone before,
certain points stand out in bold relief.</p>

<p>The scheme, or rather the execution of the scheme,
was anything but the work of a far-seeing, skilful and
well-informed mind. Nothing can illustrate this better
than the supreme folly of planting diamonds, rubies,
emeralds and sapphires in the same matrix. A capable
rogue would have consulted the history of mining for
precious stones and would have readily discovered that
they are never found associated in the same formation.
This would have enabled him to avoid a raw monstrosity
that should have led to exposure at the very start. Much
of the other work was raw, as, for instance, the diamond
and ruby spangled ant-hills and the flat rock, whose
fissures were studded with precious stones. A plain,
unornamented diamond field would have presented a far
better baited hook.</p>

<p>It can be shown by authenticated documentary evidence
that Slack and Arnold were the sole beneficiaries
of the loot. In fact, some doubt exists whether Slack
was a participant at all. Outside the sum that Lent collected,
the balance was transmitted to Arnold’s heirs, as
the records of Hardin county, Kentucky, prove.</p>

<p>Again, if any other actor in the drama had the least
foreknowledge of the fraud, he surely would have parted
with his interest while the market was booming&mdash;before
the frail bubble burst. When the coarse diamonds were
sent to London, nothing could be more certain than their
immediate identification as nearly valueless South African
stones. Yet not a share of stock was sold. Every
reasonable presumption pointed to the entire good faith<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
of all, so far as the San Francisco and New York
Mining and Commercial Company and its stockholders
were concerned.</p>

<p>Finally, it is conceivable only on the basis of downright
madness, that any man with wealth, reputation and
self-respect, in short, with everything to lose, could have
conceived and carried out such a reckless plot. If by
any chance it had succeeded, if the diamond company’s
stock had been exploited on the stock market, there was
not a place upon the earth so desolate and remote but
that the vengeance of mankind would have found him
out. It was the evident design of a rather crude intelligence
utterly regardless of consequences, and counting
on obscurity to make good.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, no matter how plain a case may seem,
no matter how free from doubt or complication, if it be
only big enough the world loves to build around it a
fairy structure of mystery or romance. Nothing could
be more evident than that Arnold and Slack were the
architects of their own work. Yet the public saw fit to
cast grave suspicion on those who were clearly victims
and heavy losers&mdash;the only ones who lost a cent. Even
Ralston, although he paid over $300,000 to make good
the losses of the stockholders, was more or less under
a cloud. Lent, Roberts, Dodge and myself were in
turn suspected. At last public opinion seemed to settle
down to a conviction that the guiding&mdash;“the master
mind”&mdash;was mine.</p>

<p>There was not an atom of valid evidence on which to
raise the accusation. On this side of the Atlantic it was
never remotely charged in any responsible paper, to my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
knowledge. The conclusion seemed to be reached very
much because of the largeness of my business undertakings
and my well-known spirit of venture in commercial
lines. Therefore, not a few assumed that because
I was always willing to take what might be called
by some a long chance, therefore, I must have been the
power behind the scenes with Arnold and Slack.</p>

<p>Not arguing the case, this conclusion had to put
aside many well known facts, as I said before. I was
a man of large wealth, making money as rapidly as was
good for anyone, so that the financial inducement was
not there. I was young, only 32, had a family of which
I was proud, had the best possible standing with business
men, both in San Francisco and abroad. Honor
bright, does it not seem incredible that a man situated
like myself, full of ambition and with everything to live
for, would have engaged in an ignoble plot to fleece his
friends and the public, a plot absolutely certain to drag
him and all belonging to him through the dust?</p>

<p>The story would have died a natural death beyond
any question just as it did in the case of my fellow victims,
had not the London Times made a direct accusation
of complicity in the diamond fraud against Alfred
Rubery and myself, which became the basis of a famous
libel suit.</p>

<i>Alfred Rubery Brings Suit Against London Times for

<p>In the charges made by the London Times, it was not
difficult to recognize the handiwork of my old enemies,
Baron Grant and the financial editor, Samson. The
accusation seemed to be an echo of the old Emma Mine
fight, when I warned the public against the exploitation
of a worthless property. That bubble had burst, carrying

than a decade of distrust for every American security in

the opportunity to retaliate was one not to be overlooked.</p>

<p>Alfred Rubery, being a British subject in good standing,
brought the libel suit against the London Times.
As my intimate and close companion for nine months,
covering the various incidents involved, he admitted that
whatever involved me involved himself as well. Although
the earth was ransacked for evidence to connect
us with the fraud, the defense absolutely failed to sustain
the newspaper’s charges. Not only that, but the
proof I had gathered, as described in a previous chapter
showing the secret bond between Baron Grant and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>

ruin of both. Samson was dismissed in disgrace by the
London Times. Enough was shown of Baron Grant’s
methods to involve him in lawsuits innumerable that
stripped him of his fortune in the end. He did business
under assumed names long after, but never with his old
success.</p>

<p>Heavy damages were awarded Rubery&mdash;the sum, if
I remember right, was £10,000. Years afterwards he
moved to Australia, and as I never heard from him
after, I presume that, like the other actors in the diamond field
drama, he is dead. In fact, of all who were
in any material way connected with the historic incident&mdash;and
there were many&mdash;I alone survive.</p>

<p>For myself, I felt crushed beneath the burden of
vague suspicion, became disgusted with life in general
and with business in particular, and formed a determination
to retire permanently from active affairs at once.
With this end in view, I offered my extensive California
holdings on a dead market and accepted bargain
prices. My controlling interest in the Montgomery
Street Land Company I sold to Messrs. Ralston and
Sharon, so that they owned share and share alike. I
sold a great acreage of tule land to George D. Roberts,
part of which comprises what is known as Roberts
Island, not far from the city of Stockton. A large estate
around Honey Lake I disposed of to various purchasers.
Scattering investments in San Francisco were
cleaned up in a summary way. I would hardly care
to know what all these properties are worth to-day.</p>

<p>In four months after the diamond fraud was exposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
I had converted into cash everything tangible I possessed
on the Pacific Coast. Although the sacrifice I
made was enormous, I realized more than a million and
a quarter dollars, which was as good or better than
$5,000,000 to-day&mdash;a fortune ample to supply the most
extensive and up-to-date wants of modern times.</p>

<p>The great mistake of my career, entirely apart from
monetary reasons, was this hastily taken resolution to
seek the shades of private life. Had I faced the music,
like all the rest&mdash;like Ralston, Lent, Roberts, Dodge and
one or two other original “dupes,” I would have outlived
every trace of suspicion just as they did themselves.
And I am glad to give evidence at this late date, long
after all of them are dead, that they were as innocent
as children throughout the whole transaction&mdash;were the
unhappy victims of a costly confidence in men.</p>

<p>But as I took a pessimistic view of things in general
and saw fit to withdraw from public view, perhaps I
have not so much reason to complain because, in my
absence from the world, Dame Rumor was busy with
my name.</p>

<p>Three alleged histories of San Francisco, which profess
to give an accurate narrative of events, devote
much space to the diamond field fraud. Considering the
mass of documentary evidence easily accessible, the misstatements
of many facts and the omission of others is
noteworthy and may call into question the entire accuracy
of all these works. To go no further, they all
agree that the losses of stockholders were enormous,
claim that they brought suit in the State of New Jersey
against Arnold and Slack, but never recovered a cent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
Lent’s suit in Kentucky, the only place where such an
action could be maintained, is not mentioned, nor the
$300,000 which Ralston contributed to make good.
Under these conditions I should not feel hurt because
they surmise that the plot was conceived in the “active
brain of Asbury Harpending.”</p>

<p>I returned to Kentucky, made considerable investments
in agricultural land and settled down to play the
part of the country gentleman. My estate was one of
the finest in Southwestern Kentucky and became a center
of hospitality in its region. And there I made another
grave mistake&mdash;not to remain content with the
finest existence in the world, that of an independent
owner and tiller of the soil.</p>

<p>It was while I was living in my new home in Kentucky,
at peace with all mankind and oblivious of the
outside world, that I had a sharp and vivid reminder
of the unforgotten past when the papers told, one day
in August, 1875, of the failure of the Bank of California
and two days later the tragic story of my old friend
Ralston’s death.</p>

<i>Fortune Plays Cruel Trick; At Height of Ralston’s
Power His Big Bank Is Forced to Close Its Doors.</i></span></h2>

<p>Ralston succeeded D.&nbsp;O. Mills as president of the
Bank of California, in 1872. While conceding the titular
supremacy to another, and contenting himself with
the station of cashier, Ralston had always been the actual
head. In all matters of policy and large accommodation
his word was law. After the withdrawal of
Mills, the directors practically gave him a free hand.</p>

<p>All through the ascendancy of Ralston, the institution
had the splendid reputation that the Bank of California
enjoys to-day. It not only possessed the fullest confidence
of the community, but ranked as one of the
strongest banks of the United States, with agencies
throughout the civilized world and unlimited credit
everywhere. The splendor of Ralston’s hospitality, the
immense enterprises in which he was engaged, and his
vast holdings in real estate and corporate concerns, gave
him the standing of a man whose wealth was almost
beyond computation. There was not an intimation of
embarrassment when, on August 25, 1875, the Bank of
California closed its doors.</p>

<p>I was not a witness of what followed. I was living<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
quietly in my home in Kentucky. But from what I have
heard, it was one of the most intense moments in the
history of the West. For blocks around the Bank of
California stood a packed mass of pale-faced men, anticipating
ruin. What might have become an unparalleled
panic and almost universal wreck, was happily
averted by the closing of the stock exchange and the
practical suspension of business for a period long enough
to allow the community to catch its breath.</p>

<p>Ralston stood the ordeal with all the resources of
fortitude, met many patrons of the bank, admitted the
grave conditions of its finances, but contended that its
assets were very large. Everything he possessed in the
world, he said, would be used to make good.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of August 27 the directors called a
meeting. Ralston was on hand as usual, but was barred
from attendance by D.&nbsp;O. Mills. The incident, it is
said, touched him to the quick. Every director had
profited by his friendship in the days of his power and
prosperity. This seemed a harsh return in the hour of
his deep distress. He left the meeting with a dazed
and haggard face.</p>

<p>He proceeded to his home and thence to North Beach,
where he was accustomed to take a swim in the bay
when the weather was opportune. There are a number
of living witnesses of what followed. Shortly after he
entered the water other swimmers noticed that something
was amiss. His body did not sink, but he was
floating face downward. A boatman was quickly at
his side. This boatman declared that the banker was
still living. Be that as it may, when he reached the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
shore with his burden the once master spirit of the Pacific
Coast was dead.</p>

<p>How great was the hold that Ralston had on the
hearts and minds of men could only be illustrated by
the passion of grief under which the whole city bent.
His death was looked on as a common calamity. No
spectacle has ever been witnessed in modern times such
as his funeral presented. By common consent, business
of every kind was suspended in San Francisco. You
might say that the population of the city of more than
150,000 inhabitants turned out en masse. The proudest
and the humblest touched shoulders at his grave. Such
tribute was never paid to any potentate or prince.</p>

<p>There were even some who found it convenient to
make an exhibition of immoderate sorrow who might
have been more fittingly employed elsewhere.</p>

<p>I once heard a story of a French gentleman who had
suffered a domestic bereavement. A friend met him
shortly after and tendered the customary condolences.</p>

<p>“Ah! My poor wife! Yes, it was indeed a great
loss!” sighed the Frenchman.</p>

<p>“I was at your house during the funeral,” continued
the sympathetic friend, “and was deeply touched by your
manifestations of grief.”</p>

<p>“Ah! You saw me at the house,” exclaimed the bereaved
Gaul. “Many thought that fine. But you should
have seen me at the grave. There I raised hell.”</p>

<p>Very much in the same way, there was one man at
Ralston’s obsequies conspicuous for his ostentatious sorrow,
who was more responsible for his downfall than
anyone else and profited largely by his death. But after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
the funeral he was able to speak of the tragic event with
much fortitude and a certain degree of complacency.
Ralston’s death, he said, was extremely opportune&mdash;in
fact, the best thing that could have happened, for it
made easy going for everyone.</p>

<p>But nothing can be more true than the cynical words
that Shakespeare puts into the mouth of Marc Antony.
The evil a man does lives after him. The good is buried
with his bones. The city went about its business, forgot
its sorrow, which is necessary and proper, unless
the world is to be draped with perpetual mourning
weeds, forgot much of the great services Ralston rendered
California; although to this day, among the old-timers
and their descendants his name still stirs a thrill.
But all his human weaknesses have been remembered
and handed down, duly magnified, to posterity.</p>

<p>Not only that, but his memory has been assailed by
accusations of the gravest nature, relating to the failure
of the Bank of California. These charges reached me
in Kentucky, and as they did not proceed from an authoritative
source and, moreover, seemed totally inconsistent
with the character of my old friend, I made a
special visit to the Pacific Coast to investigate the circumstances
immediately preceding and associated with
his death, for the better satisfaction of myself and of
the world at large.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Testimony of Eye-witnesses and Experts Refutes
Story That Wm. C. Ralston Took His Own Life.</span><br /><br />

<i>Ruined Financier Had Deeded His Property to William
Sharon, Who Forces Widow to Accept $250,000 as
Payment in Full.</i></span></h2>

<p>Among the common traditions of William C. Ralston’s
death is the story that he committed suicide to
escape exposure. Notwithstanding the fact that a coroner’s
jury found on ample expert evidence that he died
from a cerebral attack, and the further incident that
a life insurance company promptly paid a policy of
$50,000 to his widow&mdash;a policy void by express terms
in the event of suicide&mdash;this impression seems to persist
to-day.</p>

<p>When I came to California for first-hand information
concerning my old friend’s tragic end, my earliest business
was to investigate the question of self-destruction;
for if it were a fact that he made away with himself at
a time when much explanation was needed, it would
have had assuredly an ugly look. The evidence was
all fresh and so overwhelmingly conclusive of death
from natural causes that I cannot see on what basis a
theory of suicide was reached, unless it were suggested
by ulterior motives. The testimony of eye-witnesses was
that the swimmer suddenly collapsed and floated with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
the tide. The lungs were inflated with air, not with
water, as in cases of drowning; otherwise the body
would have sunk. The features had not the ghastly
pallor that follows water suffocation; on the contrary,
they were suffused and livid as when death ensues from
a bursting blood vessel in the brain. To this physicians
gave further testimony. The sad facts were plain
enough. For many days Mr. Ralston had suffered a
mental strain against which the human machinery is
not often proof. It reached the crisis when he was excluded
from the meeting of the bank’s trustees. Then
something snapped. Perhaps the plunge in the cold
waters of the bay hurried on the catastrophe. But the
baseless story of Mr. Ralston’s suicide ought to be
finally set at rest.</p>

<p>The inside history of the failure of the Bank of California
in 1875 has never been told. About the only
definite statement ever made was that its capital stock
of $5,000,000 had been exhausted, although the institution
had resources sufficient to protect depositors. It
was rehabilitated by an assessment of $100 a share
which was paid by the stockholders, giving a new capital
of $3,000,000. Five weeks after the failure it reopened
its doors, with almost undiminished prestige,
and with all the many ups and downs of finance has
maintained its position as the leading commercial bank
west of the Missouri River.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that Mr. Ralston owed large sums
of money to the bank, growing out of many investments,
some of which were disastrous. In those days, whatever
may be said of the practice, it was the commonest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
thing for bank officers to make loans to themselves. Not
only that, but the practice was in full swing down to
the time of the failure of the Safe Deposit Company’s
Bank. With vast visible personal resources as security
for loans, Mr. Ralston’s unlimited credit never seems
to have been questioned by the directors of the Bank of
California. Among his assets were a half interest in
the Palace Hotel; a half interest in the Montgomery
Street Land Company, which he and I organized, including
the Grand Hotel, and most of the frontage on
New Montgomery street; one-half of the capital stock
of the Spring Valley Water Works; one-half interest
in the Union Milling and Mining Company, which controlled
the reduction of ores on the Comstock Lode with
enormous profits, and one-third of the stock of the Virginia
and Truckee Railroad, which holds the record of
earning more per mile than any railroad in the world
before or since. I should say that a conservative estimate
of these properties alone was not less than $15,000,000.
Besides, he had numberless industrial investments,
residences and immense acreages of real estate
in various parts of California.</p>

<p>After I left San Francisco in the early part of 1873,
Mr. Ralston engaged in many costly projects. One of
these was the purchase of the Catholic Church property
on Market street, and the construction of the Palace
Hotel thereon by himself and William Sharon. This
alone tied up $3,000,000 of ready money on his account.
It is known that he lost heavily on a large purchase of
stock in the Ophir Mining Company, upon false information
that the great Flood and O’Brien bonanza<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
extended into its territory. Several months before the
failure he saw that he was deeply involved. Mr. Ralston
realized too late that he had gone too far, that he
was beyond his depth. He made efforts to secure money
on his great holdings. But for evident reason he was
compelled to go slow. The spectacle of Ralston as a
borrower would have started suspicion at once. Loans
were attempted through outside agents, but the door of
accommodation was closed. Rumor has attributed this
to the manipulation of the Bonanza firm, but a much
better reason can be given than that. Nearly all the
ready capital on the Pacific Coast was tied up in the
wild Comstock speculation, still at its height. There
was no money available for legitimate investments or
loans of any kind. On top of this came the withdrawal
of many large accounts. On the day of the failure more
than $1,000,000 were unexpectedly checked out. Under
this last blow the bank went down. So far as the
Bonanza firm was involved, its members were personal
friends of Ralston, though not of William Sharon.</p>

<p>Four days before the failure Mr. Ralston made a deed
to William Sharon, conveying “all and singular my real
and personal property situated in the City and County
of San Francisco and the County of San Mateo and
elsewhere and wheresoever and howsoever situated, to
be managed, sold and otherwise disposed of for our
joint and several interests.”</p>

<p>What was the disposition of this vast property? No
one will ever know. Was part of it used to repay any
indebtedness of Mr. Ralston to the bank? Again the
record is silent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span></p>

<p>Some years later Mr. Ralston’s widow, who is still
living, brought a suit against William Sharon for an
accounting under the deed of her deceased husband.
After some delay, Mr. Sharon filed a general answer to
the effect that the property coming from Mr. Ralston
into his hands was worth about a million dollars less
than nothing. But he offered $250,000 in full settlement,
and to avoid the endless delay of litigation and expenses
that she did not have the means to meet, this adjustment
was accepted by Mrs. Ralston.</p>

<p>Never in the whole history of finance has such a mystery
attached as surrounds the failure of the Bank of
California and the disappearance of Ralston’s fortune.
My own firm belief is that had his life been spared
another month, he would have emerged from all his
difficulties with a clean sheet. James R. Keene, a trustee
of the Bank of California and the only one who
seemed inclined to speak, made a printed statement that
upon an examination of Mr. Ralston’s assets he was
justified in stating that they were sufficient to pay all
his debts of every kind and leave a balance of $3,000,000
to his family; and it is worthy of remark that
Keene had a very clear business head.</p>

<p>No one seemed anxious to know the facts. Quite
the contrary was the case. When I proceeded to gather
information of a most important character, J.&nbsp;D. Fry,
uncle of Mrs. Ralston, commanded me in the name of
the family to cease. To this I had to bow. But Mrs.
Ralston is here to say whether her kinsman was her
faithful friend or not.</p>

<p>Even Mr. Ralston’s private papers and personal accounts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
were seized, and disappeared. In some ways he
was a secretive man. Once he asked me to send a check
to A.&nbsp;A. Cohen for $5,000 each month until ordered
discontinued. I followed instructions till the total
amounted to over $100,000, yet I never had an inkling
what the payments were for. Thus, it was currently
believed that he had many interests in other people’s
names. Mrs. Ralston well remembers that her husband
took her to inspect a fine business block in process of
completion, which he told her was his. After his death
the title to this same property stood in the name of
another, and in that family name it stands to-day.</p>

<p>There were many wild rumors of wrongdoing that
followed the failure of the Bank of California. The
only one deserving notice is this: that Mr. Ralston over-issued
and marketed stock of the Bank of California.
Without any evidence to support it that would be received
in any court, this unfounded charge has received
an astonishing credence, for I can find nothing to
support it except absolutely irresponsible hearsay. Besides,
it is contradicted by unquestioned facts.</p>

<p>Mr. Ralston had no reason to over-issue any stock.
He had oceans of prime securities. What he needed
was cash, not certificates of shares. His 50,000 shares
of Spring Valley alone had a selling market value at
that time of $5,000,000, nearly twice as much as the
bank started business with later on. The money simply
wasn’t in the town to realize on even that splendid
security. That’s how Ralston and the bank went down.</p>

<p>In a way, my acquaintance with Mr. Ralston was
somewhat tragic. With the best intent on either side,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
something always went wrong. It changed the whole
character and purpose of my life. But I only recall him
as a most loyal, consistent friend, a financier with a
very nice sense of honor and an exemplar of candid
courtesy. It seems to me the time has come when tardy
justice should be done to the memory of one of California’s
most illustrious pioneers, who loved his State
as no man of station has loved it since, and to whom
the present generation owes much.</p>

<p>All the various people of the story have been accounted
for and decently retired. Before the curtain
falls I have just a word to say about myself to those
who have followed the narrative of sixteen tempestuous
years from 1857 to 1873.</p>

<p>The role of a Kentucky country gentleman was not to
my liking. As I have said, I sold out everything and
retired from California after the bursting of the diamond
bubble. I resolved that nothing should tempt me again
into an active career. But the lure of the busy world
was more potent than I realized. After a few years of
the simple life I made my headquarters in New York,
studied and grasped the investment and speculative markets,
and became one of the recognized figures of Wall
Street.</p>

<p>At the period of his Wall Street
operations</p></div></div>

<p>Good fortune, as a rule, attended my ventures. Sometimes
the tide turned the other way, but I think, taking
one year with another, each saw my assets materially
increased. At one time I was worth very near if not
quite four million dollars, which is distinctly more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
any man ought to have. But when one is fairly gone
in the money-making intoxication he never knows when
to stop, any more than the victim of alcohol.</p>

<p>When I was at the zenith of my good luck I was
induced to invest in two mining properties in the United
States of Columbia, South America. One was an immense
silver mining district, the other a great hydraulic
proposition with almost fabulous gold-bearing gravel
resources. Both were passed upon favorably by the
ablest experts that money could hire. The reports were
justified by the facts, yet both projects ended in ruinous
disaster to me.</p>

<p>I was drawn into a much larger investment than I
contemplated. As I developed the silver property, the
economy of a much larger plant and the ownership of
adjacent mineral territory became self-evident. There
appeared no element of risk. Silver, after various fluctuations,
seemed to have reached a firm level. Financial
experts were in accord that the price of the white
metal could not possibly go lower, was much more
likely to advance than to recede. Even with silver at 80
cents an ounce, the profits on my mining operations
would be enormous. I figured to clear such profits that
in a few years I would receive back my capital investment
and own a property with an earning capacity of
millions. In fact, during the period of practical operation
these estimates were fully borne out.</p>

<p>Then something happened. Without a note of warning
to the commercial world, Great Britain closed the
mints of India to the coinage of silver. As long as this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
vast Oriental market was open, the value of silver was
secure. When it closed, like the snapping of a trap, a
panic followed which did not end until the price was
squarely cut in two. I could not produce an ounce of
bullion without an actual loss. An immense investment
became instantly valueless. Nearly three million dollars
vanished into thin air with the scratching of a pen.</p>

<p>The hydraulic mining project fared no better. The
gold gravel deposit appeared humanly inexhaustible. All
the physical conditions seemed favorable. Water had
to be brought in a ditch for twenty-three miles. Most
of the ditch, carrying 10,000 miner’s inches of water,
was completed. Then something happened again. For
nearly a mile at its upper end the line of the ditch ran
along a rather steep hillside of shale foundation. When
the surface was broken, the whole mountain seemed to
get in motion. Millions of tons slid down, bringing to
naught every effort of our engineers. Money, as a
rule, will in the end conquer every physical obstacle.
But about this time a third thing happened, most serious
of all: my funds ran so low that to continue the enterprise
further meant an invitation to a final and complete
disaster.</p>

<p>My fortune was not lost. It is still intact, buried in
the mountains of the United States of Colombia. I have
no doubt that some adventurous speculator of the future,
under happier conditions, will dig it out.</p>

<p>Since then I have been a miner and dealer in mining
properties, with the common average of the miner’s ups
and downs. Much of my time has been devoted to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>

have outlived not alone nearly all my contemporaries,
covered by this narrative, but the turbulence and ardor
of my early years as well. But while many illusions
inseparable from the imagination of a robust and enterprising
youth have disappeared, I still have very definite
ambitions to pull off one more surprise on the world before
the close. There may yet be a sequel, another

<p class="newpage p2">[The above was written nearly two years ago. Since
then Mr. Harpending’s ambition has been realized. He
sold one of his mines on the Mother Lode and after
